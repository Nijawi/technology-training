# Material for Centre for Digital Scholarship sessions

Instructions and notes for courses held at the Centre for Digital Scholarship

Author: Stéphane Guillou

Date: 2018-05

Based on work by: Paula Andrea Martinez

## Description

Here you will find notes for R, Shell and Git sessions held at the Centre for Digital Scholarhip (part of the University of Queensland's Library).

### Format

Courses use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together.
An Etherpad is used to list useful links, exercises and to interact.

Files available for each course, hosted in this repository:

* Markdown notes that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* An HTML Etherpad export that can be used to initialise a pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org is recommended to publish);
* A text file that describes the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub.
