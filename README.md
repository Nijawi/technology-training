Based on work by: Paula Andrea Martinez

## Description

Here you will find notes for R, Shell and Git sessions held at the Centre for Digital Scholarhip (part of the University of Queensland's Library).

### Format

Courses use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together.
An Etherpad is used to list useful links, exercises and to interact.

Documents available for each course:

* Markdown notes that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* An HTML Etherpad export that can be used to initialise a pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org is recommended to publish);
* A text file that describes the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub.
