# Digital Scholars Hub resources

Here you will find resources related to R, Python, Bash, Git, OpenStreetMap, QGIS, OpenRefine and Audacity sessions held at the UQ Library.

Other training resources are also available [on the Library website](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training/software-training-resources).

## Format

Most sessions use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together. A collaborative online pad is used to list useful links, challenges, and to interact during the session.

## Quick access to course resources

### R sessions

These R sessions are listed in the recommended order.

This is the Library's **regular R cycle**:

### One-off sessions

Some sessions are not run regularly, but files can also be hosted here.

| Introduction to scientific programming | [md](intro_to_programming/intro_to_programming.md) <sup>[source](intro_to_programming/intro_to_programming.Rmd)</sup> | [html](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/edit/Op8PvBdGbBxBO9efXUuEYGlB/) |

### Files hosted here

Files available for each course, hosted in this repository:

* **Markdown notes** that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* A **HTML pad export** that can be used to initialise a collaborative pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org, https://cryptpad.fr/code and https://demo.codimd.org/ are recommended to publish);
* A **description** of the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub (although it is more straight-forward to base it on a duplicate of a past event in the StudentHub admin interface).
