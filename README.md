Title: DSH resources

## Description

Here you will find resources related to R, Python, Shell, Git, OpenStreetMap, QGIS and OpenRefine sessions held at the Digital Scholars Hub (DSH, part of the University of Queensland's Library).

### Format

Most sessions use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together.
A collaborative online pad is used to list useful links, exercises and to interact.

Files available for each course, hosted in this repository:

* Markdown notes that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* A HTML pad export that can be used to initialise a pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org, https://cryptpad.fr/code and https://demo.codimd.org/ are recommended to publish);
* A text file that describes the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub.
