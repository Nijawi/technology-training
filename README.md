## Description

Here you will find resources related to R, Python, Bash, Git, OpenStreetMap, QGIS and OpenRefine and Audacity sessions held at the UQ Library.

### Format

Most sessions use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together.
A collaborative online pad is used to list useful links, exercises and to interact.

Files available for each course, hosted in this repository:

* Markdown notes that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* A HTML pad export that can be used to initialise a pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org, https://cryptpad.fr/code and https://demo.codimd.org/ are recommended to publish);
* A text file that describes the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub.
