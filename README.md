Instructions and notes for sessions held at the [Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/locations-hours/centre-digital-scholarship) (CDS).

## Description

Here you will find resources related to R, Python, Shell, Git and OpenRefine sessions held at the Centre for Digital Scholarhip (part of the University of Queensland's Library).

### Format

Most sessions use the "live-coding" format in which the instructor and the attendees type and execute commands together.
A collaborative online pad is used to list useful links, exercises and to interact.

Files available for each course, hosted in this repository:

* Markdown notes that the instructor can use to teach, and that students can refer to after the course;
* A HTML pad export that can be used to initialise a pad (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org or https://cryptpad.fr/code are recommended to publish);
* A text file that describes the session, useful to create an event on StudenHub.
