## Intro to ggplot2

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Add some text

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Another heading

This chunk is shown but not run:

```{r base_r_plot, eval=FALSE}
plot(c(1,2,3))
```

Fin!
