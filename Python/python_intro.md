# Python with Spyder: introduction to data science

This hands-on course will get you started on using Python 3 and the Spyder IDE to import, explore, analyse and visualise data.

## Setup

The easiest way to use Python 3 and Spyder is to install the Anaconda distribution. Make sure you download the Python 3 version.

## Introducing Python and Spyder

Python is a programming language that can be used to build programs but it can also be used to analyse data by importing a number of useful libraries.

We are using the Spyder IDE to interact with Python more comfortably.

Python can be used interactively, or we can build scripts and programs with it.

We will start by using the IPython console to work interactively.

## Maths

We can use Python like a calculator.

## Variables

Variables will store data.

## Data types

Int, float, Strings

Booleans

Lists

Dict ??? Set ???

### Mutable vs immutable

### Indexing

Starts at 0, does not include upper bound.

## Functions

min

max

sum

round

len

## Finding help

To install more: might need Pip, or from the Anaconda Navigator.

```
python -m pip install SomePackage
```

### NumPy for arrays

import numpy as np

### Pandas for data frames

import pandas as pd

### Updates?

## Loops

For

While

### Comprehension



## Custom functions

def my_function(arg1, arg2):
	prod = arg1 * arg2
	return prod

## Example project

### Create a new project

Create a project with `Projects > New project...`

### Import data

with pandas

### Analyse data

...

### Visualise data
