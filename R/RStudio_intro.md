Thanks for attending this session at the UQ library Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS). Please complete the following feedback form before leaving: https://framaforms.org/cds-sessions-feedback-1521148191

If you want to review the installation instructions: https://github.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

Everything we write today will be saved in your R project. If you use the University computers, please remember to save your files in your H drive or USB.

Manuals, commands and more information on how to continue your R learning are provided in our community resource in this etherpad: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/rstudio-intro-cds
After the workshop you can save this etherpad with the important links and information (top right double arrow, export).

## RStudio

RStudio is an open source IDE (Integrated Development Interface) for the R programming language.
We can use R for calculations and visualisations.

## Keep in mind

* Case sensitive
* No spaces in names
* Be ready to learn a new language, lots of new vocabulary

## Open RStudio

* If you are using your own laptop please open RStudio
  * Make sure you have a working internet connection

* On CDS computers:
  * Log in with your UQ username and password
  * Make sure you have a working internet connection
  * Go to search at bottom left corner (magnifiying glass) 
  * Open the ZENworks application
  * Look for the letter R 
  * Double click on RStudio which will install both R and RStudio 

## What are we going to learn?

At the end of this session you will be able to:

   * Create a project for data analysis
   * Create a folder structure
   * Know where to find help
   * Import files/datasets
   * Understand and move around layouts 
   * Use a few shortcuts
   * Know where packages are

## Material

### Location

Please create a folder called "RProjects" under "Documents"
This is important for our project structure

### Rstudio Project

**Exercise 1** - New RStudio Project (2 min)

* Click the "File" menu button (top left corner), then "New Project"
* Click "New Directory"
* Click "New Project" ("New empty project" if you have an older version of RStudio)
* In Directory name type the name of your project, e.g. "RStudio_Intro" (Browse and select a folder where to locate your project, in our case the RProjects folder)
* Click the "Create Project" button
    
FYI: Projects make managing multiple directories straightforward. You can create a .Rproj file in a new directory or an existing directory that already has R code and data. The .Rproj file stores information about our folder structure and the objects in the project (hence, manages history and .RData).

### Help

There are 3 ways to find help in R

1. help(functionname)
2. functionname F1
3. ?functionname

**Exercise 2** - Use the help pages to find out what these functions do:

* `sessionInfo()`
* `list.files()`
* `ls()`

`sessionInfo()` provides information about your platform, the version of R and the packages that you are using and their versions.
`list.files()` lists all the files in your working directory.
`ls()` lists the objects in the current R environment.
For example, try running the `ls()` function after executing the command `a <- 42`.
Now, remove all objects from the environment with:

```
rm(list = ls())
```
And list files again with `ls()`.

Here are more functions to explore:

* `getwd()`
* `setwd()`
* `citation()`
* `dir()`

### Creating a folder structure

We are creating 2 folders:

* scripts
* data

For that, we use the function `dir.create()`:

```
dir.create("scripts")
dir.create("data")
```
    
**Exercise 3** - create a folder called "plots"

To create a folder called "plots":

```
dir.create("plots")
```

### Scripts

Scripts are useful to save a set of useful commands and make research reproducible.

**Exercise 4** - Create a new R script file

* click the button (+) located at the top left corner of your RStudio
* click on R script
* Save the file: File > Save (or ctrl + s or command + s)
* name the file "myscript.R"
* locate this file under the "scripts" folder

You can also create a script with the following command:

```
file.create("scripts/cmds.R")
```

... or using the shortcuts Ctrl + Shift + N (or Cmd + Shift + N).

To delete a file, use the `file.remove()` function:

```
file.remove("scripts/cmds.R")
```

You can recall your recent commands with the up arrow, which is especially useful to correct typos or slightly modify a long command.

**Exercise 5** - Add comments to your new R script file

Comments start with `#`

```
# Description:
# Author:
# Date:
```

To add comments to many lines: Ctrl + Shift + C or Cmd + Shift + C

While editing your script, you can run the active line (or the selected block of lines) by using Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter).

Instead of opening an RProject, you can open an R script and directly execute its content. This is helpful to re-run a whole project from the beginning (including necessary `library()` commands).

### Import files

**Exercise 6** - Read the description of these functions:

```
?download.file
?read.table
?read.csv
```

**Exercise 7** â€“ Import data

Copy, paste and execute the following two commands:

```
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", destfile = "data/gapminderdata.csv")
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminderdata.csv")
```

What do you think they do? Describe each one in detail.

You can type the name of your new object to print it to screen:

```
gapminder
```

Now find out more about the `str()` function, and have a look at the data:

```
?str
str(gapminder)
```

Remember that you can check what is in your environment with `ls()`, and remove objects with `rm()`.

### Plotting

R has a number of plotting functions to visualise data in many different ways. Let's test the basic function `plot()`:

```
plot(pop~year, data = gapminder, main = "Population growth by year", xlab = "year", ylab = "population")
```

We are now going to create the same plot, but with extra wrapping functions that will allow us to save a copy of it.

```
png(filename = "plots/plot_population.png")
plot(pop~year, data = gapminder, main = "Population growth by year", xlab = "year", ylab = "population")
dev.off()
```

In this set of commands, `png()` creates a graphics file, `plot()` plots the data, and `dev.off()` shuts down the graphics device.


### More shortcuts

* Run current line/selection: Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter)
* Find: Ctrl + F (or Cmd + F)
* Find in files: Ctrl + Shift + F (or Cmd + Shift + F)
* Cut: Ctrl + X (or Cmd + X)
* Copy: Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C)
* Paste: Ctrl + V (or Cmd + V)
* Select all: Ctrl + A (or Cmd + A)
* Delete line: Ctrl + D (or Cmd + D)
* Clear console: Ctrl + L (or Cmd  + L)
* Indent: Tab (at start of line)
* Outdent: Shift + Tab
* Insert `<-`: Alt + - (or Option + -)
* (Un)Comment lines: Ctrl + Shift + C (or Cmd + Shift + C)
* See shortcuts: Alt + Shift + K

#### Layouts

* Move focus to Console Ctrl+2
* Move focus to Help Ctrl+3
* Show History Ctrl+4
* Show Files Ctrl+5
* Show Plots Ctrl+6
