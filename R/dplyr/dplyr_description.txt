 
Intro to R data manipulation using dplyr

---

Learn to organise your data with the R package `dplyr` in this hands-on session.

---

In this hands-on session, you will use RStudio and the `dplyr` package to manipulate your data.

Specifically, you will learn how to explore, filter and reorganise your data with the following verbs:
    • select()
    • filter()
    • group_by()
    • summarise()
    • mutate()

We recommend that you bring your own laptop and have R and RStudio installed, however the software is also available on the CDS computers. Please come 15 minutes earlier to setup your computer and files.
To install R and RStudio refer to the instructions:
https://github.com/orchid00/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

It is recommended to attend the "R for beginners using RStudio" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before.

If you interested in other R sessions please search for RStudio on StudentHub
