 
Intro to R data manipulation using dplyr

---

Manipulate your data with RStudio and dplyr in this hands-on session.

---

In this hands-on session, you will use RStudio and the dplyr package to manipulate your data.

Specifically, you will learn how to explore, filter and reorganise your data with the following verbs:
    • select()
    • filter()
    • group_by()
    • summarise()
    • mutate()

The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if you need to install the software).

To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions:
https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

It is recommended to attend the "Introduction to R with RStudio" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before. You can review the online material: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md

If you are interested in other R sessions, please search for "RStudio" on StudentHub or see the list of events on the CDS website: https://web.library.uq.edu.au/locations-hours/centre-digital-scholarship
