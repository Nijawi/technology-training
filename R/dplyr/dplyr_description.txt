 
R data manipulation with RStudio and dplyr: introduction

---

Manipulate your data with RStudio and dplyr in this hands-on R session.

---

In this hands-on session offered by the Digital Scholars Hub, you will use RStudio and the dplyr package to manipulate your tabular data.

Specifically, you will learn about six dplyr "verbs" that can be used to:

    filter data depending on conditions
    sort data
    remove variables
    create new variables
    collapse data to a summary
    operate on separate groups

The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 20 minutes earlier).

To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

It is recommended to attend the "R with RStudio: getting started" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before. If it is not available on StudentHub, you can review the material online: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md
