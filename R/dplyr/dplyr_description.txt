 
R data manipulation with RStudio and dplyr: introduction

---

Manipulate your data with RStudio and dplyr in this hands-on R session.

---

<p>
	In this hands-on session offered by the Library's Digital Scholars Hub, you will use RStudio and the dplyr package to transform your tabular data.
</p>
<p>
	Specifically, you will learn about six dplyr "verbs" that can be used to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>filter data depending on conditions</li>
	<li>sort data</li>
	<li>remove variables</li>
	<li>create new variables</li>
	<li>collapse data to a summary</li>
	<li>operate on separate groups</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if you haven't).
</p>
<p>
	To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions:

	It is recommended to attend the "R with RStudio: getting started" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before. If it is not available on StudentHub, you can review the written material 
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md">online</a> or watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDTNbP7_OQ">screencast</a>.<a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md"></a>
