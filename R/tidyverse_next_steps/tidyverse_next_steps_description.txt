R and the Tidyverse: next steps

---

Learn about tidy data and functional programming with extra Tidyverse packages, including tidyr and purrr

---

<p>
	The Digital Scholars Hub (DSH) is offering this one-off session on learning more about the R language and the Tidyverse <em>dialect</em>.
</p>
<p>
	It is recommended to have followed the DSH's sessions on the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, but not essential if you have used Tidyverse packages before. If you want to review the material for the DSH sessions, they are <a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS#quick-access-to-course-resources">available online</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In this intermediate session, we will explore the purr and tidyr functions to reorganise, manipulate and process data. We will also learn about how we can associate them with other Tidyverse functions from dplyr, ggplot2 and others.
</p>
<p>
	This is a convivial, hands-on workshop so feel free to bring in some edible treats to share with your peers!
</p>
<p>
	The software is available on the training computers, but feel free to bring your own laptop (please make sure you have R and RStudio installed beforehand).
