R and the Tidyverse: next steps

---

Learn about tidy data and functional programming with extra Tidyverse packages, including tidyr and purrr

---

<p>
	The Library's Digital Scholars Hub (DSH) is offering this free session on learning more about the R language and the Tidyverse <em>dialect</em>.
</p>
<p>
	It is recommended to have followed the DSH's sessions on the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, but not essential if you have used Tidyverse packages before. If you want to review the material for the DSH sessions, they are <a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS#quick-access-to-course-resources">available online</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In this intermediate session, we will explore the <strong>purr</strong> and <strong>tidyr</strong> packages to reorganise, manipulate and process data. We will also learn about how we can associate them with other Tidyverse functions from dplyr, ggplot2 and others.
</p>

	 	The software is available on the training room's computers. If you  prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but  please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if  you haven't).
