Introduction to R data visualisation with RStudio and the plotting package `ggplot2`

--- Description

The Centre for Digital Scholarship is offering a free session designed for people who have used R and RStudio before but are new to plotting data with the `ggplot2` package.

During this hands-on session, you will:

   * install a visualisation package (ggplot2);
   * learn to explore data;
   * learn about the "Grammar of Graphics";
   * learn about basic `ggplot2` layers;
   * create different kinds of plots;
   * be able to modify plots quickly.

Please make sure you have the necessary software installed on your personnal computer **before** the session. You will need two pieces of software: you first need to install R, and then RStudio. Installation instructions are available at https://github.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md
If you already have the software installed, please make sure that you have the latest versions.

If you haven't been able to install the software beforehand, please come 15 minutes early so the lesson is not delayed.

It is recommended to have followed the CDS session "R for beginners using RStudio" before attending this one.
