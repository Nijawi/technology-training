Introduction to R data visualisation with RStudio and the plotting package `ggplot2`

--- Description

The Centre for Digital Scholarship is offering a free session designed for people who have used R and RStudio before but are new to plotting data with the `ggplot2` package.

During this hands-on session, you will:

   * Have a visualisation package installed (`ggplot2`)
   * Learn how to explore data
   * Learn about the basic ggplot2 components
   * Use different kinds of visualisations
   * Layer several visualisations
   * Learn how to amend colours, labels, themes and coordinates

The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if you need to install the software).

To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions:
https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

It is recommended to attend the "Introduction to R with RStudio" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before.

If you are interested in other R sessions, please search for "RStudio" on StudentHub or see the list of events on the CDS website: https://web.library.uq.edu.au/locations-hours/centre-digital-scholarship
