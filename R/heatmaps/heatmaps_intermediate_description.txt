Heatmaps in R for intermediate users

--- Summary

Intermediate R graphics session to learn how to visualise data with heatmaps

--- Description

The UQ Library's Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) is offering a free R intermediate session on heatmaps. This is a hands-on session.

If you want to use your own laptop, make sure you haveÂ R and RStudio installed before coming to the workshop. You first need to install R and then RStudio, the instructions are here: https://github.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

If you prefer, the software is also available on the CDS computers (if you want to use one of these computers, please come 10 min earlier to load the software). Please note that places are limited.

Only register if you:
- have used R and RStudio before, and
- have a basic understanding of heatmaps.

If you are not yet familiar with R, we recommend you take one of the RStudio intro sessions, and then one of the R graphics introduction sessions using ggplot2.

If you have R-specific questions, you are welcome to book a time for consultation via email: cds@library.uq.edu.au. Other training can be planned after consultation with CDS staff.
