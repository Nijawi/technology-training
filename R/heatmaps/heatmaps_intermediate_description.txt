R data visualisation with RStudio: heatmaps

--- Summary

Intermediate R graphics session to learn how to visualise data with heatmaps

--- Description

The UQ Library's Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) is offering a free R intermediate session on heatmaps. This is a hands-on session.

In this session, you will learn about different options to generate heatmaps and dendrograms. You will also learn about preparing data before visualising it.

Only register if you:
- have used R and RStudio before, and
- have a basic understanding of heatmaps.

It is recommended to attend the "Introduction to R with RStudio" session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before. The material is available online: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md

The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if you need to install the software).

To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions:
https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md
