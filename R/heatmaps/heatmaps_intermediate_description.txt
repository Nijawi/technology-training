Intermediate R graphics session to learn how to visualise data with heatmaps

--- Description

<p>
	The Library's Digital Scholars Hub (DSH) is offering a free R intermediate session on heatmaps. This is a hands-on session.
</p>
<p>
	In this session, you will learn how to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>use different packages to generate heatmaps and dendrograms</li>
	<li>prepare or generate data before visualising it</li>
	<li>modify colour scales</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 	The software is available on the training room's computers. If you  prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but  please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if  you haven't).
</p>
<p>
	 	To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions: 	<br>

<p>
		It is recommended to attend the "R with RStudio: getting started"  session prior to this one, but not essential if you have used R before.  If it is not available on StudentHub, you can review the written  material  	<a href="https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md">online</a> or watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDTNbP7_OQ">screencast</a>.
