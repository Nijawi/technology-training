--- Title of session

R visualisations using ggplot2 â€“ intermediate

--- Summary

Intermediate session for R data visualisation with RStudio and the plotting package `ggplot2`

--- Description

The UQ Library Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) is offering a free R intermediate session on graphics using the `ggplot2` package.

During this hands-on session, you will:

* learn more about the layers used in ggplot2;
* select your own colours;
* modify aesthetics like shape and size;
* modify scales and labels;
* use facets;
* experiment with new geometries;
* learn how to modify plots quickly.

Please make sure you have the necessary software installed on your personnal computer **before** the session. You will need two pieces of software: you first need to install R, and then RStudio. Installation instructions are available at https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md
If you already have the software installed, please make sure that you have the latest versions.

If you haven't been able to install the software beforehand, please come 15 minutes early so the lesson is not delayed.

You should be familiar with R and ggplot2 to attend this session. It is recommended (but not essential) to have followed the CDS session "Introduction to R visualisations using ggplot2" before attending this one (the material is available online: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/ggplot2_intro/ggplot2_intro.md).
