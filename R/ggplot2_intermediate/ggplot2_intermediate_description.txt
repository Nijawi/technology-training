--- Summary

Intermediate session for R data visualisation with RStudio and the plotting package `ggplot2`

--- Description

The UQ Library Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) is offering a free R intermediate session on graphics using the `ggplot2` package.

During this hands-on session, you will:

* install a tool for picking colours;
* customise scales and ranges;
* divide a visualisation into facets;
* explore new geometries;
* modify statistical transformations;
* adjust a geometry's position;
* further modify themes.

The software is available on the training room's computers. If you prefer to use your own laptop, you are also welcome to bring it in (but please install the software beforehand, or come 15 minutes earlier if you need to install the software).

To install R and RStudio on your own laptop, refer to the instructions:
https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md

You should be familiar with R and ggplot2 to attend this session. It is recommended (but not essential) to have followed the CDS session "Introduction to R visualisations using ggplot2" before attending this one (the material is available online: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/ggplot2_intro/ggplot2_intro.md).
