# Main terms and concepts in R

* **Argument**: sometimes called "options", arguments are used to tell a function what to do. They are separated by commas, inside the function's parentheses.
* **Function**: a small program that has a name directly followed by parentheses. Between the parentheses, we can specify arguments to tell the function what to do.
* **Object**: also called a "variable" in other languages, this is what you create to store information (and what you see in your Environment tab)
