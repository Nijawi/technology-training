Git version control for collaboration

--- summary

Learn how to use Git to keep a history of your work and collaborate with peers.

--- description

Git is a version control system that allows researchers and developers to work on a project in a distributed fashion, and that makes collaboration more traceable and robust.

The Centre of Digital Scholarship (CDS) offers a 2-h introductory session in which you will:

* learn how to use the command line to keep track of your project's history;
* create an account on GitLab;
* collaborate with others on a remote repository.

The software is available on the library computers, but you are encouraged to use your personal laptop. Please install the required software before coming to the workshop. Follow the instructions here: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/Git/installation.md

You might want to attend "Introduction to the Unix Shell" at the CDS to familiarise yourself with the command line beforehand. (Not essential. Material available online: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/Shell/shell_intro.md)
