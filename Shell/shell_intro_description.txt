Introduction to the Unix Shell

--- Summary

Learn how to use the Unix shell to automate repetitive tasks and write short scripts.
 
--- Description

Learning how to use a shell (specifically the most popular Unix shell, Bash) will allow you to automate repetitive tasks, write scripts to save and share a set of useful commands, and potentially control a remote server or super-computer.

The Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS) offers this short and dense introduction, directed at beginners, in which you will learn how to:

* navigate, create and modify files and directories through the shell;
* use pipes and filters to achieve more complex operations;
* use loops to automate repetitive tasks;
* write scripts to store and share a set of useful commands.

No prior experience with the Unix shell is expected.

Please bring your own laptop and  make sure you install the required software **before** coming to the workshop: https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/Shell/installation.md
If you haven't set up the software on your computer, please come 15 minutes earlier so we can start on time.
The software is also available on the library computers.
