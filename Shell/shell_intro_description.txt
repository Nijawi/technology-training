Learning how to use a command shell (specifically the most popular Unix shell, Bash) will allow you to automate repetitive tasks, write scripts to save and share a set of useful commands, and potentially control a remote server or super-computer.

This short and dense introduction, directed at beginners, will teach you how to:
- navigate, create and modify files and directories through the shell;
- use pipes and filters to achieve more complex operations;
- use loops to automate repetitive tasks;
- write scripts to store and share a set of useful commands.

No prior experience with the Unix shell is expected, but a basic understanding of how a computer works and what a hierarchic filesystem is will make the material more accessible.

Please bring your own laptop and  make sure you install the required software **before** coming to the workshop: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html
If you haven't set up the software on your computer, please come 15 minutes earlier.
