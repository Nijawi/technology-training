Introduction to scientific programming
================

6 December 2018

Welcome!
--------

This workshop assumes no prior technical knowledge and focuses on:

-   using a language interactively in a Command Line Interface
-   introducing concepts and tools central to scientific programming
-   working with source code efficiently
-   automating tasks and enhancing reproducibility with small programs

This seminar will focus on the R language for a hands-on practice and extensive examples, but other languages will be presented, highlighting the differences between options.

The best way to learn is to practise, so we will quickly get into coding by all typing and executing the same commands. This is called "live-coding".

Installation
------------

Today, we will use R and RStudio. They are available on the library's training computers, but if you want to use your own laptop, please follow the instructions here: <https://gitlab.com/stragu/CDS/blob/master/R/Installation.md>

Introduction
------------

Let's start by adding our names and some info about us in our collaborative pad.

See how we can use some code to format our document? This is called **Markdown**, which is a concise language designed to easily create HTML documents. We are already coding!

### Why programming?

Programming allows you to use a programming language to build programs and **execute tasks**. There are many programs around, both Open Source and proprietary, that researchers can use to execute tasks by using a graphical user interface – or **GUI** – and clicking on buttons. You might however find that the programs you have been recommended do not help you with the specific task that you want to achieve, or at least do not do it efficiently.

Programming allows you to **automate** tasks by, for example, using loops to repeat a task many times, and creating functions to avoid writing the same code many times over.

Another added benefit to programming is that you can **share** your code with a team or with peers, and include it in a publication, in order to increase **reproducibility**.

Finally, because of the text-based nature of your program, you can use tools to keep track of **version history** and of **authorship** when collaborating with others.

### What language?

There are many languages you can use. They differ with their syntax, what they were designed for, and the size of the community that is actively using them.

In scientific computing, **R** and **Python** are two very popular languages. R was designed as a language for statistical analysis to be used interactively, whereas Python is more generalist.

### GUI vs CLI

A **GUI** gives the user visual elements to interact with the program, for example a button to click on in order to do a task.

A command-line interface, or **CLI**, takes an input (a command), executes it and sometimes prints some output.

Languages like R and Python can be used interactively in a command-line interface, which allows us to experiment and quickly get some results. However, if we need to create more complex series of steps for our data processing, it becomes more comfortable to work with **scripts**.

### IDE

An integrated development environment, or **IDE**, is a program that allows to write code more comfortably. Code is only text, and can therefore always be written in the most simple text editor, but an IDE makes it easier to work with code, test it, execute it, and sometimes find help and visualise output.

RStudio is an IDE primarily designed to work on R code.

Programming with R
------------------

### Getting to know R

Let's open RStudio and start using the R language interactively.

The most simple thing we can do with R is using it as a calculator, with the help of **binary operators**.

For example, try executing the following commands:

R can be used like a calculator. Try the following commands:

    3 * 4
    10 / 2
    11^6

### Objects

We can store data by creating objects, and assigning values to them with the **assignement operator** `<-`:

    num1 <- 42
    num2 <- x / 9
    str1 <- "Hello world!"

You can use the shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> to type the assignement operator quicker.

> Different objects have different classes and will be handled differently.

### Using functions

An R function looks like this:

    <functionname>(<argument(s)>)

In the console, we write a command and then evaluate it by pressing Enter.

For example, try running the following command:

    sqrt(x = num1)

#### Finding help

There are two main ways to find help about a function inside RStudio:

1.  the shortcut command: `?functionname`
2.  the keyboard shortcut: press <kbd>F1</kbd> with your cursor in a function name

**Exercise 1** - Use the help pages to find out what these functions do:

-   `c()`
-   `sum()`
-   `rm()`
-   `length()`
-   `list.files()`

`c()` concatenates the arguments into a vector.

`sum()` returns the sum of several numbers.

`seq()` creates a sequence of numbers from the parameters you give it.

`rm()` removes an object from your environment.

`length()` returns the length of a vector.

`list.files()` lists all the files in a directory.

Let's do some more complex operations by combining two functions:

`ls()` lists the objects in the current R environment. For example, try running the `ls()` function after executing the command `num3 <- 42`.

You can remove *all* the objects in the environment by using `ls()` as the value for the `list` argument:

    rm(list = ls())

> Arguments can be named, or can be automatically matched if used in order.

### Packages

Base R contains quite a few functions, and you can already build most things from scratch.

However, other people have already developped many functions for specific uses, and made them available to all via **packages**.

We can install packages with a command. For example, to install the package `praise`:

``` r
install.packages("praise")
```

We now need to **load** the package to access its functions:

``` r
library(praise) # load the package
praise() # use a function
```

    ## [1] "You are remarkable!"

### Custom functions

We can create our own **custom function**, so we can reuse code easily:

``` r
greeting <- function(name) {
  paste0(name, " is my name. Hello World! :)")
}
```

> Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to go to the line without executing the command.

If I try running my function without a value for the argument `name`, I will get an error.

I can include a default value if I want to:

``` r
greeting <- function(name = "Jane Doe") {
  paste0(name, " is my name. Hello World! :)")
}
```

### Loops

If you want to execute something many times, you can use a **loop**:

``` r
for (i in 1:100) {
  print(":D")
}
```

### Logical operators, booleans and if statements

A **logical operator** returns a **boolean**: TRUE or FALSE.

Common ones are `==` for equality, `!=` for inequality, `>` for greater than, `<` for smaller than, `>=` for greater or equal, and `<=` for smaller or equal.

Try those examples:

``` r
1 == 1
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
1 != 1
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
3 > 4
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
7 <= c(7, 8, 6)
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

With these tools, we can check for conditions, for example in an **`if` statement**:

``` r
number = rnorm(1)
if (number > 0) {
  print("Positive")
} else {
  print("Negative")
}
```

    ## [1] "Positive"

### Indexing

**Indexing** allows use to access a part of an object.

``` r
fact <- c("People", "are", "alright")
fact[1]
```

    ## [1] "People"

``` r
fact[3] <- "hopeless"
fact[4] <- "right"
fact[nchar(fact) < 7]
```

    ## [1] "People" "are"    "right"

> Indexing in R starts at 1. Most other languages start at 0.

An example project
------------------

Let's put what we just learned to use with a concrete example!

### Creating a project

File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project

### Our data

We are going to work on a dataset of ten books from Project Gutenberg. We want to get some numbers on them, and to search for the frequency of some terms. But we want to make sure that we **automate the process**, as we are likely to do that on many more books.

Download the dataset from <https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/rqOEQQCjcwBv36x/download> and unzip it inside your project directory.

### Creating a script

Working from a **script** is a lot more comfortable, and allows us to create a succession of steps to reproduce our process – in other words, a little program.

The RStudio source pane helps us writing code thanks to:

-   handy shortcuts
-   syntax highlighting
-   automatic indentation
-   feedback on code errors
-   commenting

After building a script, we can execute in one click of a button.

You can create a script from the File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.

### Import a book

``` r
Anthem <- readLines("data/AynRand_Anthem.txt")
```

### Clean up the data

`stringr` is a useful library to work with strings.

``` r
library(stringr)
```

> You can find a handy cheatsheet for this package here: <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf>

The books all have a header and a footer that we want to remove.

``` r
start <- str_which(Anthem, "START OF TH") + 1
end <- str_which(Anthem, "END OF TH") - 1
Anthem_sub <- Anthem[start:end]
```

We also want to convert everything to lowercase:

``` r
Anthem_lower <- str_to_lower(Anthem_sub)
```

And remove the empty lines:

``` r
Anthem_clean <- Anthem_lower[Anthem_lower != ""]
```

### Analyse the book

We want to find how characters the book contains:

<li>and to put <span class='match'>the<\/span>m down upon a paper no others are to see. it is base and<\/li>\n  <li>evil. it is as if we were speaking alone to no ears but our own. and<\/li>\n  <li>we know well that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no transgression blacker than to do or think<\/li>\n  <li>alone. we have broken <span class='match'>the<\/span> laws. the laws say that men may not write<\/li>\n  <li>unless <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of vocations bid them so. may we be forgiven!<\/li>\n  <li>but this is not <span class='match'>the<\/span> only sin upon us. we have committed a greater crime,<\/li>\n  <li>and for this crime <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no name. what punishment awaits us if it be<\/li>\n  <li>discovered we know not, for no such crime has come in <span class='match'>the<\/span> memory of men<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are no laws to provide for it.<\/li>\n  <li>it is dark here. <span class='match'>the<\/span> flame of the candle stands still in the air.<\/li>\n  <li>nothing moves in this tunnel save our hand on <span class='match'>the<\/span> paper. we are alone<\/li>\n  <li>here under <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth. it is a fearful word, alone. the laws say that<\/li>\n  <li>none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for this is <span class='match'>the<\/span> great<\/li>\n  <li>transgression and <span class='match'>the<\/span> root of all evil. but we have broken many laws.<\/li>\n  <li>and now <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is nothing here save our one body, and it is strange to<\/li>\n  <li>see only two legs stretched on <span class='match'>the<\/span> ground, and on the wall before us the<\/li>\n  <li>shadow of our one head.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads without<\/li>\n  <li>sound, black and glistening as blood. we stole <span class='match'>the<\/span> candle from the<\/li>\n  <li>larder of <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers. we shall be sentenced to ten<\/li>\n  <li>years in <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace of corrective detention if it be discovered. but<\/li>\n  <li>this matters not. it matters only that <span class='match'>the<\/span> light is precious and we<\/li>\n  <li>should not waste it to write when we need it for that work which is our<\/li>\n  <li>crime. nothing matters save <span class='match'>the<\/span> work, our secret, our evil, our precious<\/li>\n  <li>work. still, we must also write, for--may <span class='match'>the<\/span> council have mercy upon<\/li>\n  <li>us!--we wish to speak for once to no ears but our own.<\/li>\n  <li>our name is equality 7-2521, as it is written on <span class='match'>the<\/span> iron bracelet<\/li>\n  <li>which all men wear on <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir left wrists with their names upon it. we are<\/li>\n  <li>twenty-one years old. we are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re are not many men who are six feet tall. ever have the teachers and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> leaders pointed to us and frowned and said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span>re is evil in your bones, equality 7-2521, for your body has grown<\/li>\n  <li>beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> bodies of your brothers.\" but we cannot change our bones nor<\/li>\n  <li>our body.<\/li>\n  <li>we were born with a curse. it has always driven us to thoughts which are<\/li>\n  <li>forbidden. it has always given us wishes which men may not wish. we know<\/li>\n  <li>that we are evil, but <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no will in us and no power to resist it.<\/li>\n  <li>this is our wonder and our secret fear, that we know and do not resist.<\/li>\n  <li>we strive to be like all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men, for all men must be alike.<\/li>\n  <li>over <span class='match'>the<\/span> portals of the palace of the world council, there are words cut<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> marble, which we repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:<\/li>\n  <li>  \"we are one in all and all in one.<\/li>\n  <li>  <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are no men but only the great _we_,<\/li>\n  <li>  one, indivisible and forever.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>se words were cut long ago. there is green mould in the grooves of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more<\/li>\n  <li>years than men could count. and <span class='match'>the<\/span>se words are the truth, for they are<\/li>\n  <li>written on <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace of the world council, and the world council is the<\/li>\n  <li>body of all truth. thus has it been ever since <span class='match'>the<\/span> great rebirth, and<\/li>\n  <li>far<span class='match'>the<\/span>r back than that no memory can reach.<\/li>\n  <li>but we must never speak of <span class='match'>the<\/span> times before the great rebirth, else we<\/li>\n  <li>are sentenced to three years in <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace of corrective detention. it<\/li>\n  <li>is only <span class='match'>the<\/span> old ones who whisper about it in the evenings, in the home<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> useless. they whisper many strange things, of the towers which<\/li>\n  <li>rose to <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky, in those unmentionable times, and of the wagons which<\/li>\n  <li>moved without horses, and of <span class='match'>the<\/span> lights which burned without flame. but<\/li>\n  <li>those times were evil. and those times passed away, when men saw <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>great truth which is this: that all men are one and that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no<\/li>\n  <li>will save <span class='match'>the<\/span> will of all men together.<\/li>\n  <li>all men are good and wise. it is only we, equality 7-2521, we alone who<\/li>\n  <li>were born with a curse. for we are not like our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. and as we look<\/li>\n  <li>back upon our life, we see that it has ever been thus and that it has<\/li>\n  <li>brought us step by step to our last, supreme transgression, our crime of<\/li>\n  <li>crimes hidden here under <span class='match'>the<\/span> ground.<\/li>\n  <li>we remember <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the infants where we lived till we were five<\/li>\n  <li>years old, toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r with all the children of the city who had been born<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> same year. the sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare<\/li>\n  <li>of all things save one hundred beds. we were just like all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n, save for the one transgression: we fought with our brothers. there<\/li>\n  <li>are few offenses blacker than to fight with our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, at any age and<\/li>\n  <li>for any cause whatsoever. <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of the home told us so, and of all<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> children of that year, we were locked in the cellar most often.<\/li>\n  <li>when we were five years old, we were sent to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the students,<\/li>\n  <li>where <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are ten wards, for our ten years of learning. men must learn<\/li>\n  <li>till <span class='match'>the<\/span>y reach their fifteenth year. then they go to work. in the home<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> students we arose when the big bell rang in the tower and we went<\/li>\n  <li>to our beds when it rang again. before we removed our garments, we stood<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> great sleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said<\/li>\n  <li>all toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r with the three teachers at the head:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we are nothing. mankind is all. by <span class='match'>the<\/span> grace of our brothers are we<\/li>\n  <li>allowed our lives. we exist through, by and for our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs who are the<\/li>\n  <li>state. amen.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we slept. the sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all<\/li>\n  <li>things save one hundred beds.<\/li>\n  <li>we, equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the<\/li>\n  <li>students. it was not that <span class='match'>the<\/span> learning was too hard for us. it was that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> learning was too easy. this is a great sin, to be born with a head<\/li>\n  <li>which is too quick. it is not good to be different from our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs,<\/li>\n  <li>but it is evil to be superior to <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. the teachers told us so, and they<\/li>\n  <li>frowned when <span class='match'>the<\/span>y looked upon us.<\/li>\n  <li>so we fought against this curse. we tried to forget our lessons, but we<\/li>\n  <li>always remembered. we tried not to understand what <span class='match'>the<\/span> teachers taught,<\/li>\n  <li>but we always understood it before <span class='match'>the<\/span> teachers had spoken. we looked<\/li>\n  <li>upon union 5-3992, who were a pale boy with only half a brain, and we<\/li>\n  <li>tried to say and do as <span class='match'>the<\/span>y did, that we might be like them, like union<\/li>\n  <li>5-3992, but somehow <span class='match'>the<\/span> teachers knew that we were not. and we were<\/li>\n  <li>lashed more often than all <span class='match'>the<\/span> other children.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the councils, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> councils are the voice of all justice, for they are the voice of all<\/li>\n  <li>men. and if sometimes, in <span class='match'>the<\/span> secret darkness of our heart, we regret<\/li>\n  <li>that which befell us on our fifteenth birthday, we know that it was<\/li>\n  <li>through our own guilt. we had broken a law, for we had not paid heed to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> words of our teachers. the teachers had said to us all:<\/li>\n  <li>\"dare not choose in your minds <span class='match'>the<\/span> work you would like to do when you<\/li>\n  <li>leave <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the students. you shall do that which the council of<\/li>\n  <li>vocations shall prescribe for you. for <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of vocations knows in<\/li>\n  <li>its great wisdom where you are needed by your bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men, better than<\/li>\n  <li>you can know it in your unworthy little minds. and if you are not needed<\/li>\n  <li>by your bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r man, there is no reason for you to burden the earth with<\/li>\n  <li>your bodies.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we knew this well, in <span class='match'>the<\/span> years of our childhood, but our curse broke<\/li>\n  <li>our will. we were guilty and we confess it here: we were guilty of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> great transgression of preference. we preferred some work and some<\/li>\n  <li>lessons to <span class='match'>the<\/span> others. we did not listen well to the history of all the<\/li>\n  <li>councils elected since <span class='match'>the<\/span> great rebirth. but we loved the science of<\/li>\n  <li>things. we wished to know. we wished to know about all <span class='match'>the<\/span> things which<\/li>\n  <li>make <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth around us. we asked so many questions that the teachers<\/li>\n  <li>forbade it.<\/li>\n  <li>we think that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> plants which grow. but the council of scholars has said that there<\/li>\n  <li>are no mysteries, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of scholars knows all things. and we<\/li>\n  <li>learned much from our teachers. we learned that <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth is flat and<\/li>\n  <li>that <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun revolves around it, which causes the day and the night. we<\/li>\n  <li>learned <span class='match'>the<\/span> names of all the winds which blow over the seas and push the<\/li>\n  <li>sails of our great ships. we learned how to bleed men to cure <span class='match'>the<\/span>m of<\/li>\n  <li>all ailments.<\/li>\n  <li>we loved <span class='match'>the<\/span> science of things. and in the darkness, in the secret hour,<\/li>\n  <li>when we awoke in <span class='match'>the<\/span> night and there were no brothers around us, but<\/li>\n  <li>only <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and<\/li>\n  <li>we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might<\/li>\n  <li>let our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to<\/li>\n  <li>be sent to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the scholars when our time would come.<\/li>\n  <li>all <span class='match'>the<\/span> great modern inventions come from the home of the scholars, such<\/li>\n  <li>as <span class='match'>the<\/span> newest one, which was found only a hundred years ago, of how to<\/li>\n  <li>make candles from wax and string; also, how to make glass, which is put<\/li>\n  <li>in our windows to protect us from <span class='match'>the<\/span> rain. to find these things, the<\/li>\n  <li>scholars must study <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth and learn from the rivers, from the<\/li>\n  <li>sands, from <span class='match'>the<\/span> winds and the rocks. and if we went to the home of the<\/li>\n  <li>scholars, we could learn from <span class='match'>the<\/span>se also. we could ask questions of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>se, for they do not forbid questions.<\/li>\n  <li>and questions give us no rest. we know not why our curse makes us seek<\/li>\n  <li>we know not what, ever and ever. but we cannot resist it. it whispers<\/li>\n  <li>to us that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are great things on this earth of ours, and that we<\/li>\n  <li>can know <span class='match'>the<\/span>m if we try, and that we must know them. we ask, why must we<\/li>\n  <li>know, but it has no answer to give us. we must know that we may know.<\/li>\n  <li>so we wished to be sent to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the scholars. we wished it so<\/li>\n  <li>much that our hands trembled under <span class='match'>the<\/span> blankets in the night, and we bit<\/li>\n  <li>our arm to stop that o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r pain which we could not endure. it was evil<\/li>\n  <li>and we dared not face our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs in the morning. for men may wish<\/li>\n  <li>nothing for <span class='match'>the<\/span>mselves. and we were punished when the council of<\/li>\n  <li>vocations came to give us our life mandates which tell those who reach<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir fifteenth year what their work is to be for the rest of their<\/li>\n  <li>days.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> council of vocations came on the first day of spring, and they sat<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> great hall. and we who were fifteen and all the teachers came<\/li>\n  <li>into <span class='match'>the<\/span> great hall. and the council of vocations sat on a high dais,<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y had but two words to speak to each of the students. they called<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> students' names, and when the students stepped before them, one<\/li>\n  <li>after ano<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, the council said: \"carpenter\" or \"doctor\" or \"cook\" or<\/li>\n  <li>\"leader.\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>n each student raised their right arm and said: \"the will<\/li>\n  <li>of our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs be done.\"<\/li>\n  <li>now if <span class='match'>the<\/span> council has said \"carpenter\" or \"cook,\" the students so<\/li>\n  <li>assigned go to work and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y do not study any further. but if the<\/li>\n  <li>council has said \"leader,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>n those students go into the home of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> leaders, which is the greatest house in the city, for it has three<\/li>\n  <li>stories. and <span class='match'>the<\/span>re they study for many years, so that they may become<\/li>\n  <li>candidates and be elected to <span class='match'>the<\/span> city council and the state council and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> world council--by a free and general vote of all men. but we wished<\/li>\n  <li>not to be a leader, even though it is a great honor. we wished to be a<\/li>\n  <li>scholar.<\/li>\n  <li>so we awaited our turn in <span class='match'>the<\/span> great hall and then we heard the council<\/li>\n  <li>of vocations call our name: \"equality 7-2521.\" we walked to <span class='match'>the<\/span> dais,<\/li>\n  <li>and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at <span class='match'>the<\/span> council. there<\/li>\n  <li>were five members of <span class='match'>the<\/span> council, three of the male gender and two of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> female. their hair was white and their faces were cracked as the<\/li>\n  <li>clay of a dry river bed. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were old. they seemed older than the<\/li>\n  <li>marble of <span class='match'>the<\/span> temple of the world council. they sat before us and they<\/li>\n  <li>did not move. and we saw no breath to stir <span class='match'>the<\/span> folds of their white<\/li>\n  <li>togas. but we knew that <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were alive, for a finger of the hand of the<\/li>\n  <li>oldest rose, pointed to us, and fell down again. this was <span class='match'>the<\/span> only<\/li>\n  <li>thing which moved, for <span class='match'>the<\/span> lips of the oldest did not move as they said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"street sweeper.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we felt <span class='match'>the<\/span> cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher to look<\/li>\n  <li>upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> faces of the council, and we were happy. we knew we had been<\/li>\n  <li>guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. we would accept our life<\/li>\n  <li>mandate, and we would work for our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, gladly and willingly, and<\/li>\n  <li>we would erase our sin against <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, which they did not know, but we<\/li>\n  <li>knew. so we were happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over<\/li>\n  <li>ourselves. we raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>clearest, <span class='match'>the<\/span> steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> will of our brothers be done.\"<\/li>\n  <li>and we looked straight into <span class='match'>the<\/span> eyes of the council, but their eyes were<\/li>\n  <li>as cold blue glass buttons.<\/li>\n  <li>so we went into <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers. it is a grey house on a<\/li>\n  <li>narrow street. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the council<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> home can tell the hours of the day and when to ring the bell.<\/li>\n  <li>when <span class='match'>the<\/span> bell rings, we all arise from our beds. the sky is green and<\/li>\n  <li>cold in our windows to <span class='match'>the<\/span> east. the shadow on the sundial marks off a<\/li>\n  <li>half-hour while we dress and eat our breakfast in <span class='match'>the<\/span> dining hall, where<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re are five long tables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups<\/li>\n  <li>on each table. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we go to work in the streets of the city, with our<\/li>\n  <li>brooms and our rakes. in five hours, when <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun is high, we return to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half hour is allowed.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we go to work again. in five hours, the shadows are blue on the<\/li>\n  <li>pavements, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not<\/li>\n  <li>bright. we come back to have our dinner, which lasts one hour. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n the<\/li>\n  <li>bell rings and we walk in a straight column to one of <span class='match'>the<\/span> city halls,<\/li>\n  <li>for <span class='match'>the<\/span> social meeting. other columns of men arrive from the homes<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> different trades. the candles are lit, and the councils of the<\/li>\n  <li>different homes stand in a pulpit, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y speak to us of our duties<\/li>\n  <li>and of our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men. then visiting leaders mount the pulpit and they<\/li>\n  <li>read to us <span class='match'>the<\/span> speeches which were made in the city council that day,<\/li>\n  <li>for <span class='match'>the<\/span> city council represents all men and all men must know. then we<\/li>\n  <li>sing hymns, <span class='match'>the<\/span> hymn of brotherhood, and the hymn of equality, and the<\/li>\n  <li>hymn of <span class='match'>the<\/span> collective spirit. the sky is a soggy purple when we return<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home. then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to the<\/li>\n  <li>city <span class='match'>the<\/span>atre for three hours of social recreation. there a play is shown<\/li>\n  <li>upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> stage, with two great choruses from the home of the actors,<\/li>\n  <li>which speak and answer all toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, in two great voices. the plays<\/li>\n  <li>are about toil and how good it is. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we walk back to the home in a<\/li>\n  <li>straight column. <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky is like a black sieve pierced by silver drops<\/li>\n  <li>that tremble, ready to burst through. <span class='match'>the<\/span> moths beat against the street<\/li>\n  <li>lanterns. we go to our beds and we sleep, till <span class='match'>the<\/span> bell rings again.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> sleeping halls are white and clean and bare of all things save one<\/li>\n  <li>hundred beds.<\/li>\n  <li>thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago when<\/li>\n  <li>our crime happened. thus must all men live until <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are forty. at<\/li>\n  <li>forty, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are worn out. at forty, they are sent to the home of the<\/li>\n  <li>useless, where <span class='match'>the<\/span> old ones live. the old ones do not work, for the<\/li>\n  <li>state takes care of <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. they sit in the sun in summer and they sit by<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> fire in winter. they do not speak often, for they are weary. the<\/li>\n  <li>old ones know that <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are soon to die. when a miracle happens and some<\/li>\n  <li>live to be forty-five, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are the ancient ones, and the children stare<\/li>\n  <li>at <span class='match'>the<\/span>m when passing by the home of the useless. such is to be our life,<\/li>\n  <li>as that of all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs and of the brothers who came before us.<\/li>\n  <li>such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime which<\/li>\n  <li>changed all things for us. and it was our curse which drove us to our<\/li>\n  <li>crime. we had been a good street sweeper and like all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r street<\/li>\n  <li>sweepers, save for our cursed wish to know. we looked too long at <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>stars at night, and at <span class='match'>the<\/span> trees and the earth. and when we cleaned<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> yard of the home of the scholars, we gathered the glass vials, the<\/li>\n  <li>pieces of metal, <span class='match'>the<\/span> dried bones which they had discarded. we wished to<\/li>\n  <li>keep <span class='match'>the<\/span>se things and to study them, but we had no place to hide them.<\/li>\n  <li>so we carried <span class='match'>the<\/span>m to the city cesspool. and then we made the discovery.<\/li>\n  <li>it was on a day of <span class='match'>the<\/span> spring before last. we street sweepers work<\/li>\n  <li>in brigades of three, and we were with union 5-3992, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y of the<\/li>\n  <li>half-brain, and with international 4-8818. now union 5-3992 are a sickly<\/li>\n  <li>lad and sometimes <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are stricken with convulsions, when their<\/li>\n  <li>mouth froths and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir eyes turn white. but international 4-8818<\/li>\n  <li>are different. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are a tall, strong youth and their eyes are like<\/li>\n  <li>fireflies, for <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is laughter in their eyes. we cannot look upon<\/li>\n  <li>international 4-8818 and not smile in answer. for this <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were not<\/li>\n  <li>liked in <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the students, as it is not proper to smile without<\/li>\n  <li>reason. and also <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were not liked because they took pieces of coal<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made<\/li>\n  <li>men laugh. but it is only our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs in the home of the artists who<\/li>\n  <li>are permitted to draw pictures, so international 4-8818 were sent to <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>home of <span class='match'>the<\/span> street sweepers, like ourselves.<\/li>\n  <li>international 4-8818 and we are friends. this is an evil thing to say,<\/li>\n  <li>for it is a transgression, <span class='match'>the<\/span> great transgression of preference, to<\/li>\n  <li>love any among men better than <span class='match'>the<\/span> others, since we must love all men<\/li>\n  <li>and all men are our friends. so international 4-8818 and we have never<\/li>\n  <li>spoken of it. but we know. we know, when we look into each o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r's eyes.<\/li>\n  <li>and when we look thus without words, we both know o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r things also,<\/li>\n  <li>strange things for which <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are no words, and these things frighten<\/li>\n  <li>us.<\/li>\n  <li>so on that day of <span class='match'>the<\/span> spring before last, union 5-3992 were stricken<\/li>\n  <li>with convulsions on <span class='match'>the<\/span> edge of the city, near the city theatre. we<\/li>\n  <li>left <span class='match'>the<\/span>m to lie in the shade of the theatre tent and we went with<\/li>\n  <li>international 4-8818 to finish our work. we came toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r to the great<\/li>\n  <li>ravine behind <span class='match'>the<\/span> theatre. it is empty save for trees and weeds.<\/li>\n  <li>beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> ravine there is a plain, and beyond the plain there lies the<\/li>\n  <li>uncharted forest, about which men must not think.<\/li>\n  <li>we were ga<span class='match'>the<\/span>ring the papers and the rags which the wind had blown from<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds. it was old and<\/li>\n  <li>rusted by many rains. we pulled with all our strength, but we could not<\/li>\n  <li>move it. so we called international 4-8818, and toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r we scraped the<\/li>\n  <li>earth around <span class='match'>the<\/span> bar. of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we<\/li>\n  <li>saw an old iron grill over a black hole.<\/li>\n  <li>international 4-8818 stepped back. but we pulled at <span class='match'>the<\/span> grill and it<\/li>\n  <li>gave way. and <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we saw iron rings as steps leading down a shaft into<\/li>\n  <li>a darkness without bottom.<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall go down,\" we said to international 4-8818.<\/li>\n  <li>\"it is forbidden,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y answered.<\/li>\n  <li>we said: \"<span class='match'>the<\/span> council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be<\/li>\n  <li>forbidden.\"<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y answered: \"since the council does not know of this hole,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re can be no law permitting to enter it. and everything which is not<\/li>\n  <li>permitted by law is forbidden.\"<\/li>\n  <li>but we said: \"we shall go, none <span class='match'>the<\/span> less.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.<\/li>\n  <li>we hung on <span class='match'>the<\/span> iron rings with our hands and our feet. we could see<\/li>\n  <li>nothing below us. and above us <span class='match'>the<\/span> hole open upon the sky grew smaller<\/li>\n  <li>and smaller, till it came to be <span class='match'>the<\/span> size of a button. but still we went<\/li>\n  <li>down. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n our foot touched the ground. we rubbed our eyes, for we could<\/li>\n  <li>not see. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n our eyes became used to the darkness, but we could not<\/li>\n  <li>believe what we saw.<\/li>\n  <li>no men known to us could have built this place, nor <span class='match'>the<\/span> men known to<\/li>\n  <li>our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs who lived before us, and yet it was built by men. it was a<\/li>\n  <li>great tunnel. its walls were hard and smooth to <span class='match'>the<\/span> touch; it felt like<\/li>\n  <li>stone, but it was not stone. on <span class='match'>the<\/span> ground there were long thin tracks<\/li>\n  <li>of iron, but it was not iron; it felt smooth and cold as glass. we<\/li>\n  <li>knelt, and we crawled forward, our hand groping along <span class='match'>the<\/span> iron line to<\/li>\n  <li>see where it would lead. but <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was an unbroken night ahead. only the<\/li>\n  <li>iron tracks glowed through it, straight and white, calling us to follow.<\/li>\n  <li>but we could not follow, for we were losing <span class='match'>the<\/span> puddle of light behind<\/li>\n  <li>us. so we turned and we crawled back, our hand on <span class='match'>the<\/span> iron line. and our<\/li>\n  <li>heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. and <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew.<\/li>\n  <li>we knew suddenly that this place was left from <span class='match'>the<\/span> unmentionable times.<\/li>\n  <li>so it was true, and those times had been, and all <span class='match'>the<\/span> wonders of those<\/li>\n  <li>times. hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew secrets which we<\/li>\n  <li>have lost. and we thought: \"this is a foul place. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are damned<\/li>\n  <li>who touch <span class='match'>the<\/span> things of the unmentionable times.\" but our hand which<\/li>\n  <li>followed <span class='match'>the<\/span> track, as we crawled, clung to the iron as if it would not<\/li>\n  <li>leave it, as if <span class='match'>the<\/span> skin of our hand were thirsty and begging of the<\/li>\n  <li>metal some secret fluid beating in its coldness.<\/li>\n  <li>we returned to <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth. international 4-8818 looked upon us and<\/li>\n  <li>stepped back.<\/li>\n  <li>\"equality 7-2521,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y said, \"your face is white.\"<\/li>\n  <li>but we could not speak and we stood looking upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>m.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y backed away, as if they dared not touch us. then they smiled, but<\/li>\n  <li>it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. but still we could not<\/li>\n  <li>speak. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n they said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall report our find to <span class='match'>the<\/span> city council and both of us will be<\/li>\n  <li>rewarded.\"<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we spoke. our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our<\/li>\n  <li>voice. we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall not report our find to <span class='match'>the<\/span> city council. we shall not report<\/li>\n  <li>it to any men.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such<\/li>\n  <li>words as <span class='match'>the<\/span>se.<\/li>\n  <li>\"international 4-8818,\" we asked, \"will you report us to <span class='match'>the<\/span> council and<\/li>\n  <li>see us lashed to death before your eyes?\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: \"rather would we<\/li>\n  <li>die.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span>n,\" we said, \"keep silent. this place is ours. this place belongs<\/li>\n  <li>to us, equality 7-2521, and to no o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men on earth. and if ever we<\/li>\n  <li>surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it also.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we saw that the eyes of international 4-8818 were full to the<\/li>\n  <li>lids with tears <span class='match'>the<\/span>y dared not drop. they whispered, and their voice<\/li>\n  <li>trembled, so that <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir words lost all shape:<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> will of the council is above all things, for it is the will of<\/li>\n  <li>our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, which is holy. but if you wish it so, we shall obey you.<\/li>\n  <li>ra<span class='match'>the<\/span>r shall we be evil with you than good with all our brothers. may<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> council have mercy upon both our hearts!\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we walked away together and back to the home of the street<\/li>\n  <li>sweepers. and we walked in silence.<\/li>\n  <li>thus did it come to pass that each night, when <span class='match'>the<\/span> stars are high and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> street sweepers sit in the city theatre, we, equality 7-2521, steal<\/li>\n  <li>out and run through <span class='match'>the<\/span> darkness to our place. it is easy to leave the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>atre; when the candles are blown out and the actors come onto the<\/li>\n  <li>stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under our seat and under <span class='match'>the<\/span> cloth<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> tent. later, it is easy to steal through the shadows and fall in<\/li>\n  <li>line next to international 4-8818, as <span class='match'>the<\/span> column leaves the theatre. it<\/li>\n  <li>is dark in <span class='match'>the<\/span> streets and there are no men about, for no men may walk<\/li>\n  <li>through <span class='match'>the<\/span> city when they have no mission to walk there. each night, we<\/li>\n  <li>run to <span class='match'>the<\/span> ravine, and we remove the stones which we have piled upon the<\/li>\n  <li>iron grill to hide it from <span class='match'>the<\/span> men. each night, for three hours, we are<\/li>\n  <li>under <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth, alone.<\/li>\n  <li>we have stolen candles from <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers, we have<\/li>\n  <li>stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought <span class='match'>the<\/span>m to this<\/li>\n  <li>place. we have stolen glass vials and powders and acids from <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> scholars. now we sit in the tunnel for three hours each night and<\/li>\n  <li>we study. we melt strange metals, and we mix acids, and we cut open <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>bodies of <span class='match'>the<\/span> animals which we find in the city cesspool. we have built<\/li>\n  <li>an oven of <span class='match'>the<\/span> bricks we gathered in the streets. we burn the wood we<\/li>\n  <li>find in <span class='match'>the<\/span> ravine. the fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance<\/li>\n  <li>upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.<\/li>\n  <li>we have stolen manuscripts. this is a great offense. manuscripts are<\/li>\n  <li>precious, for our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs in the home of the clerks spend one year to<\/li>\n  <li>copy one single script in <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir clear handwriting. manuscripts are rare<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y are kept in the home of the scholars. so we sit under the earth<\/li>\n  <li>and we read <span class='match'>the<\/span> stolen scripts. two years have passed since we found<\/li>\n  <li>this place. and in <span class='match'>the<\/span>se two years we have learned more than we had<\/li>\n  <li>learned in <span class='match'>the<\/span> ten years of the home of the students.<\/li>\n  <li>we have learned things which are not in <span class='match'>the<\/span> scripts. we have solved<\/li>\n  <li>secrets of which <span class='match'>the<\/span> scholars have no knowledge. we have come to see how<\/li>\n  <li>great is <span class='match'>the<\/span> unexplored, and many lifetimes will not bring us to the end<\/li>\n  <li>of our quest. but we wish no end to our quest. we wish nothing, save to<\/li>\n  <li>be alone and to learn, and to feel as if with each day our sight were<\/li>\n  <li>growing sharper than <span class='match'>the<\/span> hawk's and clearer than rock crystal.<\/li>\n  <li>strange are <span class='match'>the<\/span> ways of evil. we are false in the faces of our brothers.<\/li>\n  <li>we are defying <span class='match'>the<\/span> will of our councils. we alone, of the thousands who<\/li>\n  <li>walk this earth, we alone in this hour are doing a work which has no<\/li>\n  <li>purpose save that we wish to do it. <span class='match'>the<\/span> evil of our crime is not for the<\/li>\n  <li>human mind to probe. <span class='match'>the<\/span> nature of our punishment, if it be discovered,<\/li>\n  <li>is not for <span class='match'>the<\/span> human heart to ponder. never, not in the memory of the<\/li>\n  <li>ancient ones' ancients, never have men done that which we are doing.<\/li>\n  <li>and yet <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no shame in us and no regret. we say to ourselves that<\/li>\n  <li>we are a wretch and a traitor. but we feel no burden upon our spirit and<\/li>\n  <li>no fear in our heart. and it seems to us that our spirit is clear as<\/li>\n  <li>a lake troubled by no eyes save those of <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun. and in our<\/li>\n  <li>heart--strange are <span class='match'>the<\/span> ways of evil!--in our heart there is the first<\/li>\n  <li>peace we have known in twenty years.<\/li>\n  <li>part two<\/li>\n  <li>liberty 5-3000... liberty five-three thousand ... liberty 5-3000....<\/li>\n  <li>we wish to write this name. we wish to speak it, but we dare not speak<\/li>\n  <li>it above a whisper. for men are forbidden to take notice of women, and<\/li>\n  <li>women are forbidden to take notice of men. but we think of one among<\/li>\n  <li>women, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y whose name is liberty 5-3000, and we think of no others. the<\/li>\n  <li>women who have been assigned to work <span class='match'>the<\/span> soil live in the homes of the<\/li>\n  <li>peasants beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> city. where the city ends there is a great road<\/li>\n  <li>winding off to <span class='match'>the<\/span> north, and we street sweepers must keep this road<\/li>\n  <li>clean to <span class='match'>the<\/span> first milepost. there is a hedge along the road, and beyond<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> hedge lie the fields. the fields are black and ploughed, and they<\/li>\n  <li>lie like a great fan before us, with <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir furrows gathered in some hand<\/li>\n  <li>beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide apart as<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with thin, green<\/li>\n  <li>spangles. women work in <span class='match'>the<\/span> fields, and their white tunics in the wind<\/li>\n  <li>are like <span class='match'>the<\/span> wings of sea-gulls beating over the black soil.<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>re it was that we saw liberty 5-3000 walking along the furrows.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir body was straight and thin as a blade of iron. their eyes were<\/li>\n  <li>dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, no kindness and no<\/li>\n  <li>guilt. <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir hair was golden as the sun; their hair flew in the wind,<\/li>\n  <li>shining and wild, as if it defied men to restrain it. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y threw seeds<\/li>\n  <li>from <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir hand as if they deigned to fling a scornful gift, and the<\/li>\n  <li>earth was a beggar under <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir feet.<\/li>\n  <li>we stood still; for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first time did we know fear, and then pain.<\/li>\n  <li>and we stood still that we might not spill this pain more precious than<\/li>\n  <li>pleasure.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we heard a voice from the others call their name: \"liberty 5-3000,\"<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y turned and walked back. thus we learned their name, and we<\/li>\n  <li>stood watching <span class='match'>the<\/span>m go, till their white tunic was lost in the blue<\/li>\n  <li>mist.<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span> following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept our eyes<\/li>\n  <li>upon liberty 5-3000 in <span class='match'>the<\/span> field. and each day thereafter we knew the<\/li>\n  <li>illness of waiting for our hour on <span class='match'>the<\/span> northern road. and there we<\/li>\n  <li>looked at liberty 5-3000 each day. we know not whe<span class='match'>the<\/span>r they looked at us<\/li>\n  <li>also, but we think <span class='match'>the<\/span>y did. then one day they came close to the hedge,<\/li>\n  <li>and suddenly <span class='match'>the<\/span>y turned to us. they turned in a whirl and the movement<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us, straight<\/li>\n  <li>into our eyes. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was no smile on their face, and no welcome. but<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir face was taut, and their eyes were dark. then they turned as<\/li>\n  <li>swiftly, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y walked away from us.<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span> following day, when we came to the road, they smiled. they<\/li>\n  <li>smiled to us and for us. and we smiled in answer. <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir head fell back,<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir arms fell, as if their arms and their thin white neck were<\/li>\n  <li>stricken suddenly with a great lassitude. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were not looking upon<\/li>\n  <li>us, but upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky. then they glanced at us over their shoulder, as we<\/li>\n  <li>felt as if a hand had touched our body, slipping softly from our lips to<\/li>\n  <li>our feet.<\/li>\n  <li>every morning <span class='match'>the<\/span>reafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. we dared<\/li>\n  <li>not speak. it is a transgression to speak to men of o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r trades, save<\/li>\n  <li>in groups at <span class='match'>the<\/span> social meetings. but once, standing at the hedge, we<\/li>\n  <li>raised our hand to our forehead and <span class='match'>the<\/span>n moved it slowly, palm down,<\/li>\n  <li>toward liberty 5-3000. had <span class='match'>the<\/span> others seen it, they could have guessed<\/li>\n  <li>nothing, for it looked only as if we were shading our eyes from <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>sun. but liberty 5-3000 saw it and understood. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y raised their hand to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir forehead and moved it as we had. thus, each day, we greet liberty<\/li>\n  <li>5-3000, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y answer, and no men can suspect.<\/li>\n  <li>we do not wonder at this new sin of ours. it is our second transgression<\/li>\n  <li>of preference, for we do not think of all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, as we must, but<\/li>\n  <li>only of one, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir name is liberty 5-3000. we do not know why we<\/li>\n  <li>think of <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. we do not know why, when we think of them, we feel all of<\/li>\n  <li>a sudden that <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth is good and that it is not a burden to live. we<\/li>\n  <li>do not think of <span class='match'>the<\/span>m as liberty 5-3000 any longer. we have given them<\/li>\n  <li>a name in our thoughts. we call <span class='match'>the<\/span>m the golden one. but it is a sin to<\/li>\n  <li>give men names which distinguish <span class='match'>the<\/span>m from other men. yet we call them<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one, for they are not like the others. the golden one are not<\/li>\n  <li>like <span class='match'>the<\/span> others.<\/li>\n  <li>and we take no heed of <span class='match'>the<\/span> law which says that men may not think of<\/li>\n  <li>women, save at <span class='match'>the<\/span> time of mating. this is the time each spring when all<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> men older than twenty and all the women older than eighteen are sent<\/li>\n  <li>for one night to <span class='match'>the<\/span> city palace of mating. and each of the men have one<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> women assigned to them by the council of eugenics. children are<\/li>\n  <li>born each winter, but women never see <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir children and children never<\/li>\n  <li>know <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir parents. twice have we been sent to the palace of mating, but<\/li>\n  <li>it is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.<\/li>\n  <li>we had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more. today, we<\/li>\n  <li>spoke to <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge<\/li>\n  <li>by <span class='match'>the<\/span> side of the road. the golden one were kneeling alone at the moat<\/li>\n  <li>which runs through <span class='match'>the<\/span> field. and the drops of water falling from their<\/li>\n  <li>hands, as <span class='match'>the<\/span>y raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun. then the golden one saw us, and they did not move, kneeling<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white<\/li>\n  <li>tunic, from <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop<\/li>\n  <li>fell from a finger of <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir hand held as frozen in the air.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n the golden one rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had heard a<\/li>\n  <li>command in our eyes. <span class='match'>the<\/span> two other street sweepers of our brigade were<\/li>\n  <li>a hundred paces away down <span class='match'>the<\/span> road. and we thought that international<\/li>\n  <li>4-8818 would not betray us, and union 5-3992 would not understand. so<\/li>\n  <li>we looked straight upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one, and we saw the shadows of their<\/li>\n  <li>lashes on <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips. and we<\/li>\n  <li>said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"you are beautiful, liberty 5-3000.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. only their<\/li>\n  <li>eyes grew wider, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was triumph in their eyes, and it was not<\/li>\n  <li>triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"what is your name?\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"equality 7-2521,\" we answered.<\/li>\n  <li>\"you are not one of our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, equality 7-2521, for we do not wish<\/li>\n  <li>you to be.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we cannot say what <span class='match'>the<\/span>y meant, for there are no words for their meaning,<\/li>\n  <li>but we know it without words and we knew it <span class='match'>the<\/span>n.<\/li>\n  <li>\"no,\" we answered, \"nor are you one of our sisters.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"if you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall look upon you, liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>women of <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"are street sweepers sent to different parts of <span class='match'>the<\/span> city or do they<\/li>\n  <li>always work in <span class='match'>the<\/span> same places?\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span>y always work in the same places,\" we answered, \"and no one will<\/li>\n  <li>take this road away from us.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"your eyes,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y said, \"are not like the eyes of any among men.\"<\/li>\n  <li>and suddenly, without cause for <span class='match'>the<\/span> thought which came to us, we felt<\/li>\n  <li>cold, cold to our stomach.<\/li>\n  <li>\"how old are you?\" we asked.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the first<\/li>\n  <li>time.<\/li>\n  <li>\"seventeen,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y whispered.<\/li>\n  <li>and we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had been<\/li>\n  <li>thinking without reason of <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace of mating. and we thought that we<\/li>\n  <li>would not let <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one be sent to the palace. how to prevent it,<\/li>\n  <li>how to bar <span class='match'>the<\/span> will of the councils, we knew not, but we knew suddenly<\/li>\n  <li>that we would. only we do not know why such thought came to us, for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>se ugly matters bear no relation to us and the golden one. what<\/li>\n  <li>relation can <span class='match'>the<\/span>y bear?<\/li>\n  <li>still, without reason, as we stood <span class='match'>the<\/span>re by the hedge, we felt our lips<\/li>\n  <li>drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men. and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one saw it and smiled slowly, and there was in their smile<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> first sadness we had seen in them. we think that in the wisdom of<\/li>\n  <li>women <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one had understood more than we can understand.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward the road,<\/li>\n  <li>so <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one walked away from us. they took the bag of seeds, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y threw the seeds into the furrows of earth as they walked away. but<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> seeds flew wildly, for the hand of the golden one was trembling.<\/li>\n  <li>yet as we walked back to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers, we felt that<\/li>\n  <li>we wanted to sing, without reason. so we were reprimanded tonight, in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some<\/li>\n  <li>tune we had never heard. but it is not proper to sing without reason,<\/li>\n  <li>save at <span class='match'>the<\/span> social meetings.<\/li>\n  <li>\"we are singing because we are happy,\" we answered <span class='match'>the<\/span> one of the home<\/li>\n  <li>council who reprimanded us.<\/li>\n  <li>\"indeed you are happy,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y answered. \"how else can men be when they<\/li>\n  <li>live for <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir brothers?\"<\/li>\n  <li>and now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about <span class='match'>the<\/span>se words. it is<\/li>\n  <li>forbidden, not to be happy. for, as it has been explained to us, men are<\/li>\n  <li>free and <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth belongs to them; and all things on earth belong to<\/li>\n  <li>all men; and <span class='match'>the<\/span> will of all men together is good for all; and so all<\/li>\n  <li>men must be happy.<\/li>\n  <li>yet as we stand at night in <span class='match'>the<\/span> great hall, removing our garments<\/li>\n  <li>for sleep, we look upon our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs and we wonder. the heads of our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs are bowed. the eyes of our brothers are dull, and never do they<\/li>\n  <li>look one ano<span class='match'>the<\/span>r in the eyes. the shoulders of our brothers are hunched,<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir muscles are drawn, as if their bodies were shrinking and<\/li>\n  <li>wished to shrink out of sight. and a word steals into our mind, as we<\/li>\n  <li>look upon our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, and that word is fear.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in the air<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> streets. fear walks through the city, fear without name, without<\/li>\n  <li>shape. all men feel it and none dare to speak.<\/li>\n  <li>we feel it also, when we are in <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers. but<\/li>\n  <li>here, in our tunnel, we feel it no longer. <span class='match'>the<\/span> air is pure under the<\/li>\n  <li>ground. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no odor of men. and these three hours give us strength<\/li>\n  <li>for our hours above <span class='match'>the<\/span> ground.<\/li>\n  <li>our body is betraying us, for <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of the home looks with<\/li>\n  <li>suspicion upon us. it is not good to feel too much joy nor to be glad<\/li>\n  <li>that our body lives. for we matter not and it must not matter to us<\/li>\n  <li>whe<span class='match'>the<\/span>r we live or die, which is to be as our brothers will it. but we,<\/li>\n  <li>equality 7-2521, are glad to be living. if this is a vice, <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we wish<\/li>\n  <li>no virtue.<\/li>\n  <li>yet our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs are not like us. all is not well with our brothers.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re are fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise, kind eyes, who cry<\/li>\n  <li>suddenly, without reason, in <span class='match'>the<\/span> midst of day or night, and their body<\/li>\n  <li>shakes with sobs <span class='match'>the<\/span>y cannot explain. there are solidarity 9-6347, who<\/li>\n  <li>are a bright youth, without fear in <span class='match'>the<\/span> day; but they scream in their<\/li>\n  <li>sleep, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y scream: \"help us! help us! help us!\" into the night, in<\/li>\n  <li>a voice which chills our bones, but <span class='match'>the<\/span> doctors cannot cure solidarity<\/li>\n  <li>9-6347.<\/li>\n  <li>and as we all undress at night, in <span class='match'>the<\/span> dim light of the candles, our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs are silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of their<\/li>\n  <li>minds. for all must agree with all, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y cannot know if their<\/li>\n  <li>thoughts are <span class='match'>the<\/span> thoughts of all, and so they fear to speak. and they<\/li>\n  <li>are glad when <span class='match'>the<\/span> candles are blown for the night. but we, equality<\/li>\n  <li>7-2521, look through <span class='match'>the<\/span> window upon the sky, and there is peace in the<\/li>\n  <li>sky, and cleanliness, and dignity. and beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> city there lies the<\/li>\n  <li>plain, and beyond <span class='match'>the<\/span> plain, black upon the black sky, there lies the<\/li>\n  <li>uncharted forest.<\/li>\n  <li>we do not wish to look upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> uncharted forest. we do not wish to<\/li>\n  <li>think of it. but ever do our eyes return to that black patch upon <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>sky. men never enter <span class='match'>the<\/span> uncharted forest, for there is no power to<\/li>\n  <li>explore it and no path to lead among its ancient trees which stand<\/li>\n  <li>as guards of fearful secrets. it is whispered that once or twice in a<\/li>\n  <li>hundred years, one among <span class='match'>the<\/span> men of the city escape alone and run to the<\/li>\n  <li>uncharted forest, without call or reason. <span class='match'>the<\/span>se men do not return. they<\/li>\n  <li>perish from hunger and from <span class='match'>the<\/span> claws of the wild beasts which roam the<\/li>\n  <li>forest. but our councils say that this is only a legend. we have heard<\/li>\n  <li>that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are many uncharted forests over the land, among the cities.<\/li>\n  <li>and it is whispered that <span class='match'>the<\/span>y have grown over the ruins of many cities<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> unmentionable times. the trees have swallowed the ruins, and the<\/li>\n  <li>bones under <span class='match'>the<\/span> ruins, and all the things which perished. and as we look<\/li>\n  <li>upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> uncharted forest far in the night, we think of the secrets of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> unmentionable times. and we wonder how it came to pass that these<\/li>\n  <li>secrets were lost to <span class='match'>the<\/span> world. we have heard the legends of the great<\/li>\n  <li>fighting, in which many men fought on one side and only a few on <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r. these few were the evil ones and they were conquered. then great<\/li>\n  <li>fires raged over <span class='match'>the<\/span> land. and in these fires the evil ones and all the<\/li>\n  <li>things made by <span class='match'>the<\/span> evil ones were burned. and the fire which is called<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> dawn of the great rebirth, was the script fire where all the scripts<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> evil ones were burned, and with them all the words of the evil<\/li>\n  <li>ones. great mountains of flame<\/li>\n  <li>stood in <span class='match'>the<\/span> squares of the cities for<\/li>\n  <li>three months. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n came the great rebirth.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> words of the evil ones... the words of the unmentionable times...<\/li>\n  <li>what are <span class='match'>the<\/span> words which we have lost?<\/li>\n  <li>may <span class='match'>the<\/span> council have mercy upon us! we had no wish to write such a<\/li>\n  <li>question, and we knew not what we were doing till we had written it. we<\/li>\n  <li>shall not ask this question and we shall not think it. we shall not call<\/li>\n  <li>death upon our head.<\/li>\n  <li>and yet... and yet... <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is some word, one single word which is not<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> language of men, but which had been. and this is the unspeakable<\/li>\n  <li>word, which no men may speak nor hear. but sometimes, and it is rare,<\/li>\n  <li>sometimes, somewhere, one among men find that word. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y find it upon<\/li>\n  <li>scraps of old manuscripts or cut into <span class='match'>the<\/span> fragments of ancient stones.<\/li>\n  <li>but when <span class='match'>the<\/span>y speak it they are put to death. there is no crime punished<\/li>\n  <li>by death in this world, save this one crime of speaking <span class='match'>the<\/span> unspeakable<\/li>\n  <li>word.<\/li>\n  <li>we have seen one of such men burned alive in <span class='match'>the<\/span> square of the city. and<\/li>\n  <li>it was a sight which has stayed with us through <span class='match'>the<\/span> years, and it haunts<\/li>\n  <li>us, and follows us, and it gives us no rest. we were a child <span class='match'>the<\/span>n, ten<\/li>\n  <li>years old. and we stood in <span class='match'>the<\/span> great square with all the children and<\/li>\n  <li>all <span class='match'>the<\/span> men of the city, sent to behold the burning. they brought the<\/li>\n  <li>transgressor out into <span class='match'>the<\/span> square and they led them to the pyre. they<\/li>\n  <li>had torn out <span class='match'>the<\/span> tongue of the transgressor, so that they could speak no<\/li>\n  <li>longer. <span class='match'>the<\/span> transgressor were young and tall. they had hair of gold and<\/li>\n  <li>eyes blue as morning. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y walked to the pyre, and their step did not<\/li>\n  <li>falter. and of all <span class='match'>the<\/span> faces on that square, of all the faces which<\/li>\n  <li>shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, theirs was the calmest<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span> happiest face.<\/li>\n  <li>as <span class='match'>the<\/span> chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a flame set<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span> pyre, the transgressor looked upon the city. there was a thin<\/li>\n  <li>thread of blood running from <span class='match'>the<\/span> corner of their mouth, but their lips<\/li>\n  <li>were smiling. and a monstrous thought came to us <span class='match'>the<\/span>n, which has never<\/li>\n  <li>left us. we had heard of saints. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are the saints of labor, and the<\/li>\n  <li>saints of <span class='match'>the<\/span> councils, and the saints of the great rebirth. but we had<\/li>\n  <li>never seen a saint nor what <span class='match'>the<\/span> likeness of a saint should be. and we<\/li>\n  <li>thought <span class='match'>the<\/span>n, standing in the square, that the likeness of a saint was<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> face we saw before us in the flames, the face of the transgressor of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> unspeakable word.<\/li>\n  <li>as <span class='match'>the<\/span> flames rose, a thing happened which no eyes saw but ours, else<\/li>\n  <li>we would not be living today. perhaps it had only seemed to us. but it<\/li>\n  <li>seemed to us that <span class='match'>the<\/span> eyes of the transgressor had chosen us from the<\/li>\n  <li>crowd and were looking straight upon us. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was no pain in their eyes<\/li>\n  <li>and no knowledge of <span class='match'>the<\/span> agony of their body. there was only joy in them,<\/li>\n  <li>and pride, a pride holier than is fit for human pride to be. and it<\/li>\n  <li>seemed as if <span class='match'>the<\/span>se eyes were trying to tell us something through the<\/li>\n  <li>flames, to send into our eyes some word without sound. and it seemed as<\/li>\n  <li>if <span class='match'>the<\/span>se eyes were begging us to gather that word and not to let it go<\/li>\n  <li>from us and from <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth. but the flames rose and we could not guess<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> word....<\/li>\n  <li>what--even if we have to burn for it like <span class='match'>the<\/span> saint of the pyre--what is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> unspeakable word?<\/li>\n  <li>part three<\/li>\n  <li>we, equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature. and we have<\/li>\n  <li>discovered it alone, and we alone are to know it.<\/li>\n  <li>it is said. now let us be lashed for it, if we must. <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of<\/li>\n  <li>scholars has said that we all know <span class='match'>the<\/span> things which exist and therefore<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> things which are not known by all do not exist. but we think that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> council of scholars is blind. the secrets of this earth are not for<\/li>\n  <li>all men to see, but only for those who will seek <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. we know, for we<\/li>\n  <li>have found a secret unknown to all our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs.<\/li>\n  <li>we know not what this power is nor whence it comes. but we know its<\/li>\n  <li>nature, we have watched it and worked with it. we saw it first two years<\/li>\n  <li>ago. one night, we were cutting open <span class='match'>the<\/span> body of a dead frog when we saw<\/li>\n  <li>its leg jerking. it was dead, yet it moved. some power unknown to men<\/li>\n  <li>was making it move. we could not understand it. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n, after many tests,<\/li>\n  <li>we found <span class='match'>the<\/span> answer. the frog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and<\/li>\n  <li>it had been <span class='match'>the<\/span> metal of our knife which had sent the strange power<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span> copper through the brine of the frog's body. we put a piece of<\/li>\n  <li>copper and a piece of zinc into a jar of brine, we touched a wire<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, and there, under our fingers, was a miracle which had never<\/li>\n  <li>occurred before, a new miracle and a new power.<\/li>\n  <li>this discovery haunted us. we followed it in preference to all our<\/li>\n  <li>studies. we worked with it, we tested it in more ways than we can<\/li>\n  <li>describe, and each step was as ano<span class='match'>the<\/span>r miracle unveiling before us.<\/li>\n  <li>we came to know that we had found <span class='match'>the<\/span> greatest power on earth. for it<\/li>\n  <li>defies all <span class='match'>the<\/span> laws known to men. it makes the needle move and turn on<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> compass which we stole from the home of the scholars; but we had<\/li>\n  <li>been taught, when still a child, that <span class='match'>the<\/span> loadstone points to the north<\/li>\n  <li>and that this is a law which nothing can change; yet our new power<\/li>\n  <li>defies all laws. we found that it causes lightning, and never have men<\/li>\n  <li>known what causes lightning. in thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod of<\/li>\n  <li>iron by <span class='match'>the<\/span> side of our hole, and we watched it from below. we have<\/li>\n  <li>seen <span class='match'>the<\/span> lightning strike it again and again. and now we know that metal<\/li>\n  <li>draws <span class='match'>the<\/span> power of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it forth.<\/li>\n  <li>we have built strange things with this discovery of ours. we used for<\/li>\n  <li>it <span class='match'>the<\/span> copper wires which we found here under the ground. we have walked<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the way. we could go<\/li>\n  <li>no far<span class='match'>the<\/span>r than half a mile, for earth and rock had fallen at both ends.<\/li>\n  <li>but we ga<span class='match'>the<\/span>red all the things we found and we brought them to our work<\/li>\n  <li>place. we found strange boxes with bars of metal inside, with many<\/li>\n  <li>cords and strands and coils of metal. we found wires that led to strange<\/li>\n  <li>little globes of glass on <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls; they contained threads of metal<\/li>\n  <li>thinner than a spider's web.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>se things help us in our work. we do not understand them, but we<\/li>\n  <li>think that <span class='match'>the<\/span> men of the unmentionable times had known our power of the<\/li>\n  <li>sky, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>se things had some relation to it. we do not know, but we<\/li>\n  <li>shall learn. we cannot stop now, even though it frightens us that we are<\/li>\n  <li>alone in our knowledge.<\/li>\n  <li>no single one can possess greater wisdom than <span class='match'>the<\/span> many scholars who are<\/li>\n  <li>elected by all men for <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir wisdom. yet we can. we do. we have fought<\/li>\n  <li>against saying it, but now it is said. we do not care. we forget all<\/li>\n  <li>men, all laws and all things save our metals and our wires. so much is<\/li>\n  <li>still to be learned! so long a road lies before us, and what care we if<\/li>\n  <li>we must travel it alone!<\/li>\n  <li>part four<\/li>\n  <li>many days passed before we could speak to <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one again. but<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and<\/li>\n  <li>spread its flame in <span class='match'>the<\/span> air, and the fields lay still without breath,<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span> dust of the road was white in the glow. so the women of the<\/li>\n  <li>field were weary, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y tarried over their work, and they were far<\/li>\n  <li>from <span class='match'>the<\/span> road when we came. but the golden one stood alone at the hedge,<\/li>\n  <li>waiting. we stopped and we saw that <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir eyes, so hard and scornful to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> world, were looking at us as if they would obey any word we might<\/li>\n  <li>speak.<\/li>\n  <li>and we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we have given you a name in our thoughts, liberty 5-3000.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"what is our name?\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y asked.<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"nor do we call you equality 7-2521 when we think of you.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"what name have you given us?\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y looked straight into our eyes and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y held their head high and they answered:<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> unconquered.\"<\/li>\n  <li>for a long time we could not speak. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"such thoughts as <span class='match'>the<\/span>se are forbidden, golden one.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"but you think such thoughts as <span class='match'>the<\/span>se and you wish us to think them.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we looked into <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir eyes and we could not lie.<\/li>\n  <li>\"yes,\" we whispered, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y smiled, and then we said: \"our dearest<\/li>\n  <li>one, do not obey us.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.<\/li>\n  <li>\"speak <span class='match'>the<\/span>se words again,\" they whispered.<\/li>\n  <li>\"which words?\" we asked. but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y did not answer, and we knew it.<\/li>\n  <li>\"our dearest one,\" we whispered.<\/li>\n  <li>never have men said this to women.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> head of the golden one bowed slowly, and they stood still before us,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir arms at their sides, the palms of their hands turned to us, as if<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir body were delivered in submission to our eyes. and we could not<\/li>\n  <li>speak.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as if<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y wished us to forget some anxiety of their own.<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> day is hot,\" they said, \"and you have worked for many hours and you<\/li>\n  <li>must be weary.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"no,\" we answered.<\/li>\n  <li>\"it is cooler in <span class='match'>the<\/span> fields,\" they said, \"and there is water to drink.<\/li>\n  <li>are you thirsty?\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"yes,\" we answered, \"but we cannot cross <span class='match'>the<\/span> hedge.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall bring <span class='match'>the<\/span> water to you,\" they said.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two hands,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y rose and they held the water out to our lips.<\/li>\n  <li>we do not know if we drank that water. we only knew suddenly that <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir<\/li>\n  <li>hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir hands, and<\/li>\n  <li>that <span class='match'>the<\/span>y knew it, but did not move.<\/li>\n  <li>we raised our head and stepped back. for we did not understand what had<\/li>\n  <li>made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it.<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one stepped back, and stood looking upon their hands<\/li>\n  <li>in wonder. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n the golden one moved away, even though no others were<\/li>\n  <li>coming, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y moved, stepping back, as if they could not turn from<\/li>\n  <li>us, <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir arms bent before them, as if they could not lower their hands.<\/li>\n  <li>part five<\/li>\n  <li>we made it. we created it. we brought it forth from <span class='match'>the<\/span> night of the<\/li>\n  <li>ages. we alone. our hands. our mind. ours alone and only.<\/li>\n  <li>we know not what we are saying. our head is reeling. we look upon <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>light which we have made. we shall be forgiven for anything we say<\/li>\n  <li>tonight....<\/li>\n  <li>tonight, after more days and trials than we can count, we finished<\/li>\n  <li>building a strange thing, from <span class='match'>the<\/span> remains of the unmentionable times,<\/li>\n  <li>a box of glass, devised to give forth <span class='match'>the<\/span> power of the sky of greater<\/li>\n  <li>strength than we had ever achieved before. and when we put our wires to<\/li>\n  <li>this box, when we closed <span class='match'>the<\/span> current--the wire glowed! it came to life,<\/li>\n  <li>it turned red, and a circle of light lay on <span class='match'>the<\/span> stone before us.<\/li>\n  <li>we stood, and we held our head in our hands. we could not conceive of<\/li>\n  <li>that which we had created. we had touched no flint, made no fire. yet<\/li>\n  <li>here was light, light that came from nowhere, light from <span class='match'>the<\/span> heart of<\/li>\n  <li>metal.<\/li>\n  <li>we blew out <span class='match'>the<\/span> candle. darkness swallowed us. there was nothing left<\/li>\n  <li>around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in it, as a<\/li>\n  <li>crack in <span class='match'>the<\/span> wall of a prison. we stretched our hands to the wire, and<\/li>\n  <li>we saw our fingers in <span class='match'>the<\/span> red glow. we could not see our body nor feel<\/li>\n  <li>it, and in that moment nothing existed save our two hands over a wire<\/li>\n  <li>glowing in a black abyss.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us. we can light<\/li>\n  <li>our tunnel, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> city, and all the cities of the world with nothing<\/li>\n  <li>save metal and wires. we can give our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs a new light, cleaner and<\/li>\n  <li>brighter than any <span class='match'>the<\/span>y have ever known. the power of the sky can be made<\/li>\n  <li>to do men's bidding. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re are no limits to its secrets and its might,<\/li>\n  <li>and it can be made to grant us anything if we but choose to ask.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew what we must do. our discovery is too great for us to<\/li>\n  <li>waste our time in sweeping <span class='match'>the<\/span> streets. we must not keep our secret to<\/li>\n  <li>ourselves, nor buried under <span class='match'>the<\/span> ground. we must bring it into the sight<\/li>\n  <li>of all men. we need all our time, we need <span class='match'>the<\/span> work rooms of the home of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> scholars, we want the help of our brother scholars and their wisdom<\/li>\n  <li>joined to ours. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is so much work ahead for all of us, for all the<\/li>\n  <li>scholars of <span class='match'>the<\/span> world.<\/li>\n  <li>in a month, <span class='match'>the<\/span> world council of scholars is to meet in our city. it is<\/li>\n  <li>a great council, to which <span class='match'>the<\/span> wisest of all lands are elected, and it<\/li>\n  <li>meets once a year in <span class='match'>the<\/span> different cities of the earth. we shall go to<\/li>\n  <li>this council and we shall lay before <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, as our gift, this glass box<\/li>\n  <li>with <span class='match'>the<\/span> power of the sky. we shall confess everything to them. they<\/li>\n  <li>will see, understand and forgive. for our gift is greater than our<\/li>\n  <li>transgression. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y will explain it to the council of vocations, and we<\/li>\n  <li>shall be assigned to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the scholars. this has never been done<\/li>\n  <li>before, but nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r has a gift such as ours ever been offered to men.<\/li>\n  <li>we must wait. we must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it<\/li>\n  <li>before. for should any men save <span class='match'>the<\/span> scholars learn of our secret, they<\/li>\n  <li>would not understand it, nor would <span class='match'>the<\/span>y believe us. they would see<\/li>\n  <li>nothing, save our crime of working alone, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y would destroy us and<\/li>\n  <li>our light. we care not about our body, but our light is...<\/li>\n  <li>yes, we do care. for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first time do we care about our body. for this<\/li>\n  <li>wire is as a part of our body, as a vein torn from us, glowing with our<\/li>\n  <li>blood. are we proud of this thread of metal, or of our hands which made<\/li>\n  <li>it, or is <span class='match'>the<\/span>re a line to divide these two?<\/li>\n  <li>we stretch out our arms. for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first time do we know how strong our<\/li>\n  <li>arms are. and a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first<\/li>\n  <li>time in our life, what we look like. men never see <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir own faces and<\/li>\n  <li>never ask <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir brothers about it, for it is evil to have concern for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir own faces or bodies. but tonight, for a reason we cannot fathom,<\/li>\n  <li>we wish it were possible to us to know <span class='match'>the<\/span> likeness of our own person.<\/li>\n  <li>part six<\/li>\n  <li>we have not written for thirty days. for thirty days we have not been<\/li>\n  <li>here, in our tunnel. we had been caught. it happened on that night when<\/li>\n  <li>we wrote last. we forgot, that night, to watch <span class='match'>the<\/span> sand in the glass<\/li>\n  <li>which tells us when three hours have passed and it is time to return to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> city theatre. when we remembered it, the sand had run out.<\/li>\n  <li>we hastened to <span class='match'>the<\/span> theatre. but the big tent stood grey and silent<\/li>\n  <li>against <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky. the streets of the city lay before us, dark and empty.<\/li>\n  <li>if we went back to hide in our tunnel, we would be found and our light<\/li>\n  <li>found with us. so we walked to <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the street sweepers.<\/li>\n  <li>when <span class='match'>the<\/span> council of the home questioned us, we looked upon the faces of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> council, but there was no curiosity in those faces, and no anger,<\/li>\n  <li>and no mercy. so when <span class='match'>the<\/span> oldest of them asked us: \"where have you<\/li>\n  <li>been?\" we thought of our glass box and of our light, and we forgot all<\/li>\n  <li>else. and we answered:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we will not tell you.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> oldest did not question us further. they turned to the two youngest,<\/li>\n  <li>and said, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir voice was bored:<\/li>\n  <li>\"take our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r equality 7-2521 to the palace of corrective detention.<\/li>\n  <li>lash <span class='match'>the<\/span>m until they tell.\"<\/li>\n  <li>so we were taken to <span class='match'>the<\/span> stone room under the palace of corrective<\/li>\n  <li>detention. this room has no windows and it is empty save for an iron<\/li>\n  <li>post. two men stood by <span class='match'>the<\/span> post, naked but for leather aprons and<\/li>\n  <li>lea<span class='match'>the<\/span>r hoods over their faces. those who had brought us departed,<\/li>\n  <li>leaving us to <span class='match'>the<\/span> two judges who stood in a corner of the room. the<\/li>\n  <li>judges were small, thin men, grey and bent. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y gave the signal to the<\/li>\n  <li>two strong hooded ones.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y tore the clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our knees<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y tied our hands to the iron post. the first blow of the lash<\/li>\n  <li>felt as if our spine had been cut in two. <span class='match'>the<\/span> second blow stopped the<\/li>\n  <li>first, and for a second we felt nothing, <span class='match'>the<\/span>n the pain struck us in our<\/li>\n  <li>throat and fire ran in our lungs without air. but we did not cry out.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> lash whistled like a singing wind. we tried to count the blows, but<\/li>\n  <li>we lost count. we knew that <span class='match'>the<\/span> blows were falling upon our back. only<\/li>\n  <li>we felt nothing upon our back any longer. a flaming grill kept dancing<\/li>\n  <li>before our eyes, and we thought of nothing save that grill, a grill,<\/li>\n  <li>a grill of red squares, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew that we were looking at the<\/li>\n  <li>squares of <span class='match'>the<\/span> iron grill in the door, and there were also the squares<\/li>\n  <li>of stone on <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon<\/li>\n  <li>our back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we saw a fist before us. it knocked our chin up, and we saw the red<\/li>\n  <li>froth of our mouth on <span class='match'>the<\/span> withered fingers, and the judge asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"where have you been?\"<\/li>\n  <li>but we jerked our head away, hid our face upon our tied hands, and bit<\/li>\n  <li>our lips.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> lash whistled again. we wondered who was sprinkling burning coal<\/li>\n  <li>dust upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on the stones<\/li>\n  <li>around us.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one after the<\/li>\n  <li>o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, even though we knew they were speaking many minutes apart:<\/li>\n  <li>\"where have you been where have you been where have you been where have<\/li>\n  <li>you been?...\"<\/li>\n  <li>and our lips moved, but <span class='match'>the<\/span> sound trickled back into our throat, and the<\/li>\n  <li>sound was only:<\/li>\n  <li>\"<span class='match'>the<\/span> light... the light... the light....\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew nothing.<\/li>\n  <li>we opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on <span class='match'>the<\/span> brick floor of a cell.<\/li>\n  <li>we looked upon two hands lying far before us on <span class='match'>the<\/span> bricks, and we moved<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>m, and we knew that they were our hands. but we could not move our<\/li>\n  <li>body. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we smiled, for we thought of the light and that we had not<\/li>\n  <li>betrayed it.<\/li>\n  <li>we lay in our cell for many days. <span class='match'>the<\/span> door opened twice each day, once<\/li>\n  <li>for <span class='match'>the<\/span> men who brought us bread and water, and once for the judges.<\/li>\n  <li>many judges came to our cell, first <span class='match'>the<\/span> humblest and then the most<\/li>\n  <li>honored judges of <span class='match'>the<\/span> city. they stood before us in their white togas,<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"are you ready to speak?\"<\/li>\n  <li>but we shook our head, lying before <span class='match'>the<\/span>m on the floor. and they<\/li>\n  <li>departed.<\/li>\n  <li>we counted each day and each night as it passed. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n, tonight, we knew<\/li>\n  <li>that we must escape. for tomorrow <span class='match'>the<\/span> world council of scholars is to<\/li>\n  <li>meet in our city.<\/li>\n  <li>it was easy to escape from <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace of corrective detention. the locks<\/li>\n  <li>are old on <span class='match'>the<\/span> doors and there are no guards about. there is no reason<\/li>\n  <li>to have guards, for men have never defied <span class='match'>the<\/span> councils so far as to<\/li>\n  <li>escape from whatever place <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were ordered to be. our body is healthy<\/li>\n  <li>and strength returns to it speedily. we lunged against <span class='match'>the<\/span> door and<\/li>\n  <li>it gave way. we stole through <span class='match'>the<\/span> dark passages, and through the dark<\/li>\n  <li>streets, and down into our tunnel.<\/li>\n  <li>we lit <span class='match'>the<\/span> candle and we saw that our place had not been found and<\/li>\n  <li>nothing had been touched. and our glass box stood before us on <span class='match'>the<\/span> cold<\/li>\n  <li>oven, as we had left it. what matter <span class='match'>the<\/span>y now, the scars upon our back!<\/li>\n  <li>tomorrow, in <span class='match'>the<\/span> full light of day, we shall take our box, and leave our<\/li>\n  <li>tunnel open, and walk through <span class='match'>the<\/span> streets to the home of the scholars.<\/li>\n  <li>we shall put before <span class='match'>the<\/span>m the greatest gift ever offered to men. we shall<\/li>\n  <li>tell <span class='match'>the<\/span>m the truth. we shall hand to them, as our confession, these<\/li>\n  <li>pages we have written. we shall join our hands to <span class='match'>the<\/span>irs, and we shall<\/li>\n  <li>work toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, with the power of the sky, for the glory of mankind. our<\/li>\n  <li>blessing upon you, our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs! tomorrow, you will take us back into<\/li>\n  <li>your fold and we shall be an outcast no longer. tomorrow we shall be one<\/li>\n  <li>of you again. tomorrow...<\/li>\n  <li>part seven<\/li>\n  <li>it is dark here in <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest. the leaves rustle over our head, black<\/li>\n  <li>against <span class='match'>the<\/span> last gold of the sky. the moss is soft and warm. we shall<\/li>\n  <li>sleep on this moss for many nights, till <span class='match'>the<\/span> beasts of the forest come<\/li>\n  <li>to tear our body. we have no bed now, save <span class='match'>the<\/span> moss, and no future, save<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> beasts.<\/li>\n  <li>we are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried our<\/li>\n  <li>glass box through <span class='match'>the<\/span> streets of the city to the home of the scholars.<\/li>\n  <li>no men stopped us, for <span class='match'>the<\/span>re were none about from the palace of<\/li>\n  <li>corrective detention, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> others knew nothing. no men stopped us at<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> gate. we walked through empty passages and into the great hall where<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> world council of scholars sat in solemn meeting.<\/li>\n  <li>we saw nothing as we entered, save <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky in the great windows, blue<\/li>\n  <li>and glowing. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we saw the scholars who sat around a long table; they<\/li>\n  <li>were as shapeless clouds huddled at <span class='match'>the<\/span> rise of the great sky. there<\/li>\n  <li>were men whose famous names we knew, and o<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs from distant lands whose<\/li>\n  <li>names we had not heard. we saw a great painting on <span class='match'>the<\/span> wall over their<\/li>\n  <li>heads, of <span class='match'>the<\/span> twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle.<\/li>\n  <li>all <span class='match'>the<\/span> heads of the council turned to us as we entered. these great and<\/li>\n  <li>wise of <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon<\/li>\n  <li>us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a miracle. it is true that<\/li>\n  <li>our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood.<\/li>\n  <li>we raised our right arm and we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"our greeting to you, our honored bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs of the world council of<\/li>\n  <li>scholars!\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the council, spoke and<\/li>\n  <li>asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"who are you, our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r? for you do not look like a scholar.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"our name is equality 7-2521,\" we answered, \"and we are a street sweeper<\/li>\n  <li>of this city.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the<\/li>\n  <li>scholars spoke at once, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were angry and frightened.<\/li>\n  <li>\"a street sweeper! a street sweeper walking in upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> world council of<\/li>\n  <li>scholars! it is not to be believed! it is against all <span class='match'>the<\/span> rules and all<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> laws!\"<\/li>\n  <li>but we knew how to stop <span class='match'>the<\/span>m.<\/li>\n  <li>\"our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs!\" we said. \"we matter not, nor our transgression. it<\/li>\n  <li>is only our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men who matter. give no thought to us, for we are<\/li>\n  <li>nothing, but listen to our words, for we bring you a gift such as had<\/li>\n  <li>never been brought to men. listen to us, for we hold <span class='match'>the<\/span> future of<\/li>\n  <li>mankind in our hands.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they listened.<\/li>\n  <li>we placed our glass box upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> table before them. we spoke of it, and<\/li>\n  <li>of our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from <span class='match'>the<\/span> palace<\/li>\n  <li>of corrective detention. not a hand moved in that hall, as we spoke, nor<\/li>\n  <li>an eye. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we put the wires to the box, and they all bent forward and<\/li>\n  <li>sat still, watching. and we stood still, our eyes upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> wire. and<\/li>\n  <li>slowly, slowly as a flush of blood, a red flame trembled in <span class='match'>the<\/span> wire.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n the wire glowed.<\/li>\n  <li>but terror struck <span class='match'>the<\/span> men of the council. they leapt to their feet, they<\/li>\n  <li>ran from <span class='match'>the<\/span> table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled<\/li>\n  <li>toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, seeking the warmth of one another's bodies to give them<\/li>\n  <li>courage.<\/li>\n  <li>we looked upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>m and we laughed and said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"fear nothing, our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. there is a great power in these wires, but<\/li>\n  <li>this power is tamed. it is yours. we give it to you.\"<\/li>\n  <li>still <span class='match'>the<\/span>y would not move.<\/li>\n  <li>\"we give you <span class='match'>the<\/span> power of the sky!\" we cried. \"we give you the key to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> earth! take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you.<\/li>\n  <li>let us all work toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, and harness this power, and make it ease the<\/li>\n  <li>toil of men. let us throw away our candles and our torches. let us flood<\/li>\n  <li>our cities with light. let us bring a new light to men!\"<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. for their eyes<\/li>\n  <li>were still, and small, and evil.<\/li>\n  <li>\"our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs!\" we cried. \"have you nothing to say to us?\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n collective 0-0009 moved forward. they moved to the table and the<\/li>\n  <li>o<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs followed.<\/li>\n  <li>\"yes,\" spoke collective 0-0009, \"we have much to say to you.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> sound of their voices brought silence to the hall and to beat of

waited for <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth to rise and strike us<\/li>\n  <li>in <span class='match'>the<\/span> face. but we ran. we knew not where we were going. we knew only<\/li>\n  <li>that we must run, run to <span class='match'>the<\/span> end of the world, to the end of our days.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that we<\/li>\n  <li>had stopped. trees taller than we had ever seen before stood over us in<\/li>\n  <li>great silence. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we knew. we were in the uncharted forest. we had<\/li>\n  <li>not thought of coming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our<\/li>\n  <li>legs had brought us to <span class='match'>the<\/span> uncharted forest against our will.<\/li>\n  <li>our glass box lay beside us. we crawled to it, we fell upon it, our face<\/li>\n  <li>in our arms, and we lay still.<\/li>\n  <li>we lay thus for a long time. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we rose, we took our box and walked on<\/li>\n  <li>into <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest.<\/li>\n  <li>it mattered not where we went. we knew that men would not follow us, for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y never enter the uncharted forest. we had nothing to fear from them.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> forest disposes of its own victims. this gave us no fear either.<\/li>\n  <li>only we wished to be away, away from <span class='match'>the<\/span> city and from the air that<\/li>\n  <li>touches upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> air of the city. so we walked on, our box in our arms,<\/li>\n  <li>our heart empty.<\/li>\n  <li>we are doomed. whatever days are left to us, we shall spend <span class='match'>the<\/span>m alone.<\/li>\n  <li>and we have heard of <span class='match'>the<\/span> corruption to be found in solitude. we have<\/li>\n  <li>torn ourselves from <span class='match'>the<\/span> truth which is our brother men, and there is no<\/li>\n  <li>road back for us, and no redemption.<\/li>\n  <li>we know <span class='match'>the<\/span>se things, but we do not care. we care for nothing on earth.<\/li>\n  <li>we are tired.<\/li>\n  <li>only <span class='match'>the<\/span> glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives us<\/li>\n  <li>strength. we have lied to ourselves. we have not built this box for <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>good of our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. we built it for its own sake. it is above all our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs to us, and its truth above their truth. why wonder about this?<\/li>\n  <li>we have not many days to live. we are walking to <span class='match'>the<\/span> fangs awaiting us<\/li>\n  <li>somewhere among <span class='match'>the<\/span> great, silent trees. there is not a thing behind us<\/li>\n  <li>to regret.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only. we thought of the<\/li>\n  <li>golden one. we thought of <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one whom we shall never see again.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n the pain passed. it is best. we are one of the damned. it is best<\/li>\n  <li>if <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one forget our name and the body which bore that name.<\/li>\n  <li>part eight<\/li>\n  <li>it has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest.<\/li>\n  <li>we awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face. we wanted to leap<\/li>\n  <li>to our feet, as we have had to leap every morning of our life, but we<\/li>\n  <li>remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was no bell to<\/li>\n  <li>ring anywhere. we lay on our back, we threw our arms out, and we looked<\/li>\n  <li>up at <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky. the leaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled<\/li>\n  <li>like a river of green and fire flowing high above us.<\/li>\n  <li>we did not wish to move. we thought suddenly that we could lie thus as<\/li>\n  <li>long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at <span class='match'>the<\/span> thought. we could also<\/li>\n  <li>rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again. we were thinking that <span class='match'>the<\/span>se<\/li>\n  <li>were thoughts without sense, but before we knew it our body had risen in<\/li>\n  <li>one leap. our arms stretched out of <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir own will, and our body whirled<\/li>\n  <li>and whirled, till it raised a wind to rustle through <span class='match'>the<\/span> leaves of the<\/li>\n  <li>bushes. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n our hands seized a branch and swung us high into a tree,<\/li>\n  <li>with no aim save <span class='match'>the<\/span> wonder of learning the strength of our body. the<\/li>\n  <li>branch snapped under us and we fell upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> moss that was soft as a<\/li>\n  <li>cushion. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n our body, losing all sense, rolled over and over on the<\/li>\n  <li>moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face. and we heard<\/li>\n  <li>suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing as if <span class='match'>the<\/span>re<\/li>\n  <li>were no power left in us save laughter.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we took our glass box, and we went on into the forest. we went on,<\/li>\n  <li>cutting through <span class='match'>the<\/span> branches, and it was as if we were swimming through<\/li>\n  <li>a sea of leaves, with <span class='match'>the<\/span> bushes as waves rising and falling and rising<\/li>\n  <li>around us, and flinging <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir green sprays high to the treetops. the<\/li>\n  <li>trees parted before us, calling us forward. <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest seemed to welcome<\/li>\n  <li>us. we went on, without thought, without care, with nothing to feel save<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> song of our body.<\/li>\n  <li>we stopped when we felt hunger. we saw birds in <span class='match'>the<\/span> tree branches, and<\/li>\n  <li>flying from under our footsteps. we picked a stone and we sent it as an<\/li>\n  <li>arrow at a bird. it fell before us. we made a fire, we cooked <span class='match'>the<\/span> bird,<\/li>\n  <li>and we ate it, and no meal had ever tasted better to us. and we thought<\/li>\n  <li>suddenly that <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was a great satisfaction to be found in the food<\/li>\n  <li>which we need and obtain by our own hand. and we wished to be hungry<\/li>\n  <li>again and soon, that we might know again this strange new pride in<\/li>\n  <li>eating.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we walked on. and we came to a stream which lay as a streak of<\/li>\n  <li>glass among <span class='match'>the<\/span> trees. it lay so still that we saw no water but only a<\/li>\n  <li>cut in <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth, in which the trees grew down, upturned, and the sky<\/li>\n  <li>lay at <span class='match'>the<\/span> bottom. we knelt by the stream and we bent down to drink. and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we stopped. for, upon the blue of the sky below us, we saw our own<\/li>\n  <li>face for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first time.<\/li>\n  <li>we sat still and we held our breath. for our face and our body were<\/li>\n  <li>beautiful. our face was not like <span class='match'>the<\/span> faces of our brothers, for we felt<\/li>\n  <li>not pity when looking upon it. our body was not like <span class='match'>the<\/span> bodies of our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, for our limbs were straight and thin and hard and strong. and<\/li>\n  <li>we thought that we could trust this being who looked upon us from <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>stream, and that we had nothing to fear with this being.<\/li>\n  <li>we walked on till <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun had set. when the shadows gathered among the<\/li>\n  <li>trees, we stopped in a hollow between <span class='match'>the<\/span> roots, where we shall sleep<\/li>\n  <li>tonight. and suddenly, for <span class='match'>the<\/span> first time this day, we remembered that<\/li>\n  <li>we are <span class='match'>the<\/span> damned. we remembered it, and we laughed.<\/li>\n  <li>we are writing this on <span class='match'>the<\/span> paper we had hidden in our tunic together<\/li>\n  <li>with <span class='match'>the<\/span> written pages we had brought for the world council of scholars,<\/li>\n  <li>but never given to <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. we have much to speak of to ourselves, and we<\/li>\n  <li>hope we shall find <span class='match'>the<\/span> words for it in the days to come. now, we cannot<\/li>\n  <li>speak, for we cannot understand.<\/li>\n  <li>part nine<\/li>\n  <li>we have not written for many days. we did not wish to speak. for we<\/li>\n  <li>needed no words to remember that which has happened to us.<\/li>\n  <li>it was on our second day in <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest that we heard steps behind us. we<\/li>\n  <li>hid in <span class='match'>the<\/span> bushes, and we waited. the steps came closer. and then we saw<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold.<\/li>\n  <li>we leapt forward, we ran to <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, and we stood looking upon the golden<\/li>\n  <li>one.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold them, while their<\/li>\n  <li>body swayed. and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y could not speak.<\/li>\n  <li>we dared not come too close to <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. we asked, and our voice trembled:<\/li>\n  <li>\"how did you come to be here, golden one?\"<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y whispered only:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we have found you....\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"how did you come to be in <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest?\" we asked.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y raised their head, and there was a great pride in their voice; they<\/li>\n  <li>answered:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we have followed you.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we could not speak, and they said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we heard that you had gone to <span class='match'>the<\/span> uncharted forest, for the whole city<\/li>\n  <li>is speaking of it. so on <span class='match'>the<\/span> night of the day when we heard it, we ran<\/li>\n  <li>away from <span class='match'>the<\/span> home of the peasants. we found the marks of your feet<\/li>\n  <li>across <span class='match'>the<\/span> plain where no men walk. so we followed them, and we went<\/li>\n  <li>into <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest, and we followed the path where the branches were broken<\/li>\n  <li>by your body.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir white tunic was torn, and the branches had cut the skin of their<\/li>\n  <li>arms, but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y spoke as if they had never taken notice of it, nor of<\/li>\n  <li>weariness, nor of fear.<\/li>\n  <li>\"we have followed you,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y said, \"and we shall follow you wherever you<\/li>\n  <li>go. if danger threatens you, we shall face it also. if it be death,<\/li>\n  <li>we shall die with you. you are damned, and we wish to share your<\/li>\n  <li>damnation.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was bitterness<\/li>\n  <li>and triumph in <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir voice.<\/li>\n  <li>\"your eyes are as a flame, but our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs have neither hope nor fire.<\/li>\n  <li>your mouth is cut of granite, but our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs are soft and humble. your<\/li>\n  <li>head is high, but our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs cringe. you walk, but our brothers<\/li>\n  <li>crawl. we wish to be damned with you, ra<span class='match'>the<\/span>r than blessed with all our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. do as you please with us, but do not send us away from you.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us.<\/li>\n  <li>we had never thought of that which we did. we bent to raise <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden<\/li>\n  <li>one to <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir feet, but when we touched them, it was as if madness had<\/li>\n  <li>stricken us. we seized <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir body and we pressed our lips to theirs. the<\/li>\n  <li>golden one brea<span class='match'>the<\/span>d once, and their breath was a moan, and then their<\/li>\n  <li>arms closed around us.<\/li>\n  <li>we stood toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r for a long time. and we were frightened that we had<\/li>\n  <li>lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to<\/li>\n  <li>men.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"our dearest one. fear nothing of <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest. there is no danger in<\/li>\n  <li>solitude. we have no need of our bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. let us forget their good and<\/li>\n  <li>our evil, let us forget all things save that we are toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r and that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re is joy as a bond between us. give us your hand. look ahead. it is<\/li>\n  <li>our own world, golden one, a strange, unknown world, but our own.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.<\/li>\n  <li>and that night we knew that to hold <span class='match'>the<\/span> body of women in our arms is<\/li>\n  <li>nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the race of<\/li>\n  <li>men.<\/li>\n  <li>we have walked for many days. <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest has no end, and we seek no end.<\/li>\n  <li>but each day added to <span class='match'>the<\/span> chain of days between us and the city is like<\/li>\n  <li>an added blessing.<\/li>\n  <li>we have made a bow and many arrows. we can kill more birds than we need<\/li>\n  <li>for our food; we find water and fruit in <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest. at night, we choose<\/li>\n  <li>a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around it. we sleep in <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>midst of that ring, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> beasts dare not attack us. we can see their<\/li>\n  <li>eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us from <span class='match'>the<\/span> tree branches<\/li>\n  <li>beyond. <span class='match'>the<\/span> fires smoulder as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke<\/li>\n  <li>stands still in <span class='match'>the<\/span> air, in columns made blue by the moonlight. we sleep<\/li>\n  <li>toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r in the midst of the ring, the arms of the golden one around us,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir head upon our breast.<\/li>\n  <li>some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far<\/li>\n  <li>enough. but we do not have to hasten. <span class='match'>the<\/span> days before us are without<\/li>\n  <li>end, like <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest.<\/li>\n  <li>we cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it seems so<\/li>\n  <li>clear and so simple. when questions come to puzzle us, we walk faster,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n turn and forget all things as we watch the golden one following.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> shadows of leaves fall upon their arms, as they spread the branches<\/li>\n  <li>apart, but <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir shoulders are in the sun. the skin of their arms is<\/li>\n  <li>like a blue mist, but <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir shoulders are white and glowing, as if the<\/li>\n  <li>light fell not from above, but rose from under <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir skin. we watch the<\/li>\n  <li>leaf which has fallen upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir shoulder, and it lies at the curve<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir neck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a jewel. they<\/li>\n  <li>approach us, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and they<\/li>\n  <li>wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to turn and go<\/li>\n  <li>on.<\/li>\n  <li>we go on and we bless <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth under our feet. but questions come to<\/li>\n  <li>us again, as we walk in silence. if that which we have found is <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>corruption of solitude, <span class='match'>the<\/span>n what can men wish for save corruption? if<\/li>\n  <li>this is <span class='match'>the<\/span> great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is<\/li>\n  <li>evil?<\/li>\n  <li>everything which comes from <span class='match'>the<\/span> many is good. everything which comes<\/li>\n  <li>from one is evil. this have we been taught with our first breath. we<\/li>\n  <li>have broken <span class='match'>the<\/span> law, but we have never doubted it. yet now, as we walk<\/li>\n  <li>through <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest, we are learning to doubt.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of all their<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. but we lived not, when we toiled for our brothers, we were<\/li>\n  <li>only weary. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is no joy for men, save the joy shared with all their<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. but the only things which taught us joy were the power we<\/li>\n  <li>created in our wires, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one. and both these joys belong<\/li>\n  <li>to us alone, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y come from us alone, they bear no relation to all our<\/li>\n  <li>bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, and they do not concern our brothers in any way. thus do we<\/li>\n  <li>wonder.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>re is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men. what<\/li>\n  <li>is that error? we do not know, but <span class='match'>the<\/span> knowledge struggles within us,<\/li>\n  <li>struggles to be born. today, <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one stopped suddenly and said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we love you.\"<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly.<\/li>\n  <li>\"no,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y whispered, \"that is not what we wished to say.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were halting,<\/li>\n  <li>like <span class='match'>the<\/span> words of a child learning to speak for the first time:<\/li>\n  <li>\"we are one... alone... and only... and we love you who are one...<\/li>\n  <li>alone... and only.\"<\/li>\n  <li>we looked into each o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r's eyes and we knew that the breath of a<\/li>\n  <li>miracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly.<\/li>\n  <li>and we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find.<\/li>\n  <li>part ten<\/li>\n  <li>we are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper made<\/li>\n  <li>thousands of years ago. <span class='match'>the<\/span> light is dim, and we cannot see the golden<\/li>\n  <li>one, only one lock of gold on <span class='match'>the<\/span> pillow of an ancient bed. this is our<\/li>\n  <li>home.<\/li>\n  <li>we came upon it today, at sunrise. for many days we had been crossing a<\/li>\n  <li>chain of mountains. <span class='match'>the<\/span> forest rose among cliffs, and whenever we walked<\/li>\n  <li>out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great peaks before us in <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>west, and to <span class='match'>the<\/span> north of us, and to the south, as far as our eyes could<\/li>\n  <li>see. <span class='match'>the<\/span> peaks were red and brown, with the green streaks of forests as<\/li>\n  <li>veins upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, with blue mists as veils over their heads. we had never<\/li>\n  <li>heard of <span class='match'>the<\/span>se mountains, nor seen them marked on any map. the uncharted<\/li>\n  <li>forest has protected <span class='match'>the<\/span>m from the cities and from the men of the<\/li>\n  <li>cities.<\/li>\n  <li>we climbed paths where <span class='match'>the<\/span> wild goat dared not follow. stones rolled<\/li>\n  <li>from under our feet, and we heard <span class='match'>the<\/span>m striking the rocks below, farther<\/li>\n  <li>and far<span class='match'>the<\/span>r down, and the mountains rang with each stroke, and long<\/li>\n  <li>after <span class='match'>the<\/span> strokes had died. but we went on, for we knew that no men<\/li>\n  <li>would ever follow our track nor reach us here.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees, high on a<\/li>\n  <li>sheer peak before us. we thought that it was a fire and stopped. but <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>flame was unmoving, yet blinding as liquid metal. so we climbed toward<\/li>\n  <li>it through <span class='match'>the<\/span> rocks. and there, before us, on a broad summit, with the<\/li>\n  <li>mountains rising behind it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> white fire came from the sun on the glass of its windows.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor. there was<\/li>\n  <li>more window than wall upon its walls, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> windows went on straight<\/li>\n  <li>around <span class='match'>the<\/span> corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not<\/li>\n  <li>guess. <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which<\/li>\n  <li>we had seen in our tunnel.<\/li>\n  <li>we both knew it without words: this house was left from <span class='match'>the<\/span><\/li>\n  <li>unmentionable times. <span class='match'>the<\/span> trees had protected it from time and weather,<\/li>\n  <li>and from men who have less pity than time and wea<span class='match'>the<\/span>r. we turned to the<\/li>\n  <li>golden one and we asked:<\/li>\n  <li>\"are you afraid?\"<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y shook their head. so we walked to the door, and we threw it<\/li>\n  <li>open, and we stepped toge<span class='match'>the<\/span>r into the house of the unmentionable times.<\/li>\n  <li>we shall need <span class='match'>the<\/span> days and the years ahead, to look, to learn, and to<\/li>\n  <li>understand <span class='match'>the<\/span> things of this house. today, we could only look and try<\/li>\n  <li>to believe <span class='match'>the<\/span> sight of our eyes. we pulled the heavy curtains from the<\/li>\n  <li>windows and we saw that <span class='match'>the<\/span> rooms were small, and we thought that not<\/li>\n  <li>more than twelve men could have lived here. we thought it strange that<\/li>\n  <li>men had been permitted to build a house for only twelve.<\/li>\n  <li>never had we seen rooms so full of light. <span class='match'>the<\/span> sunrays danced upon<\/li>\n  <li>colors, colors, more colors than we thought possible, we who had seen<\/li>\n  <li>no houses save <span class='match'>the<\/span> white ones, the brown ones and the grey. there were<\/li>\n  <li>great pieces of glass on <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls, but it was not glass, for when we<\/li>\n  <li>looked upon it we saw our own bodies and all <span class='match'>the<\/span> things behind us, as<\/li>\n  <li>on <span class='match'>the<\/span> face of a lake. there were strange things which we had never<\/li>\n  <li>seen and <span class='match'>the<\/span> use of which we do not know. and there were globes of glass<\/li>\n  <li>everywhere, in each room, <span class='match'>the<\/span> globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such<\/li>\n  <li>as we had seen in our tunnel.<\/li>\n  <li>we found <span class='match'>the<\/span> sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its threshold. for<\/li>\n  <li>it was a small room and <span class='match'>the<\/span>re were only two beds in it. we found no<\/li>\n  <li>o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r beds in the house, and then we knew that only two had lived here,<\/li>\n  <li>and this passes understanding. what kind of world did <span class='match'>the<\/span>y have, the men<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> unmentionable times?<\/li>\n  <li>we found garments, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one gasped at the sight of them. for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were of all colors, no<\/li>\n  <li>two of <span class='match'>the<\/span>m alike. some crumbled to dust as we touched them. but others<\/li>\n  <li>were of heavier cloth, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y felt soft and new in our fingers.<\/li>\n  <li>we found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of<\/li>\n  <li>manuscripts, from <span class='match'>the<\/span> floor to the ceiling. never had we seen such<\/li>\n  <li>a number of <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, nor of such strange shape. they were not soft and<\/li>\n  <li>rolled, <span class='match'>the<\/span>y had hard shells of cloth and leather; and the letters on<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir pages were so small and so even that we wondered at the men who<\/li>\n  <li>had such handwriting. we glanced through <span class='match'>the<\/span> pages, and we saw that they<\/li>\n  <li>were written in our language, but we found many words which we could not<\/li>\n  <li>understand. tomorrow, we shall begin to read <span class='match'>the<\/span>se scripts.<\/li>\n  <li>when we had seen all <span class='match'>the<\/span> rooms of the house, we looked at the golden one<\/li>\n  <li>and we both knew <span class='match'>the<\/span> thought in our minds.<\/li>\n  <li>\"we shall never leave this house,\" we said, \"nor let it be taken from<\/li>\n  <li>us. this is our home and <span class='match'>the<\/span> end of our journey. this is your house,<\/li>\n  <li>golden one, and ours, and it belongs to no o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men whatever as far as<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> earth may stretch. we shall not share it with others, as we share<\/li>\n  <li>not our joy with <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, nor our love, nor our hunger. so be it to the end<\/li>\n  <li>of our days.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"your will be done,\" <span class='match'>the<\/span>y said.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home. we<\/li>\n  <li>brought water from <span class='match'>the<\/span> stream which runs among the trees under our<\/li>\n  <li>windows. we killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh to be<\/li>\n  <li>cooked in a strange copper pot we found in a place of wonders, which<\/li>\n  <li>must have been <span class='match'>the<\/span> cooking room of the house.<\/li>\n  <li>we did this work alone, for no words of ours could take <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one<\/li>\n  <li>away from <span class='match'>the<\/span> big glass which is not glass. they stood before it and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y looked and looked upon their own body.<\/li>\n  <li>when <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun sank beyond the mountains, the golden one fell asleep on<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and flowers of silk.<\/li>\n  <li>we lifted <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one in our arms and we carried them to a bed, their<\/li>\n  <li>head falling softly upon our shoulder. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n we lit a candle, and we<\/li>\n  <li>brought paper from <span class='match'>the<\/span> room of the manuscripts, and we sat by the<\/li>\n  <li>window, for we knew that we could not sleep tonight.<\/li>\n  <li>and now we look upon <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth and sky. this spread of naked rock and<\/li>\n  <li>peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world that<\/li>\n  <li>waits. it seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a first<\/li>\n  <li>commandment. we cannot know what word we are to give, nor what great<\/li>\n  <li>deed this earth expects to witness. we know it waits. it seems to say it<\/li>\n  <li>has great gifts to lay before us, but it wishes a greater gift for us.<\/li>\n  <li>we are to speak. we are to give its goal, its highest meaning to all<\/li>\n  <li>this glowing space of rock and sky.<\/li>\n  <li>we look ahead, we beg our heart for guidance in answering this call no<\/li>\n  <li>voice has spoken, yet we have heard. we look upon our hands. we see<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> dust of centuries, the dust which hid the great secrets and perhaps<\/li>\n  <li>great evils. and yet it stirs no fear within our heart, but only silent<\/li>\n  <li>reverence and pity.<\/li>\n  <li>may knowledge come to us! what is <span class='match'>the<\/span> secret our heart has understood<\/li>\n  <li>and yet will not reveal to us, although it seems to beat as if it were<\/li>\n  <li>endeavoring to tell it?<\/li>\n  <li>part eleven<\/li>\n  <li>i am. i think. i will.<\/li>\n  <li>my hands... my spirit... my sky... my forest... this earth of mine....<\/li>\n  <li>what must i say besides? <span class='match'>the<\/span>se are the words. this is the answer.<\/li>\n  <li>i stand here on <span class='match'>the<\/span> summit of the mountain. i lift my head and i spread<\/li>\n  <li>my arms. this, my body and spirit, this is <span class='match'>the<\/span> end of the quest. i<\/li>\n  <li>wished to know <span class='match'>the<\/span> meaning of things. i am the meaning. i wished to<\/li>\n  <li>find a warrant for being. i need no warrant for being, and no word of<\/li>\n  <li>sanction upon my being. i am <span class='match'>the<\/span> warrant and the sanction.<\/li>\n  <li>it is my eyes which see, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> sight of my eyes grants beauty to the<\/li>\n  <li>earth. it is my ears which hear, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> hearing of my ears gives its<\/li>\n  <li>song to <span class='match'>the<\/span> world. it is my mind which thinks, and the judgement of<\/li>\n  <li>my mind is <span class='match'>the<\/span> only searchlight that can find the truth. it is my<\/li>\n  <li>will which chooses, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> choice of my will is the only edict i must<\/li>\n  <li>respect.<\/li>\n  <li>many words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are false,<\/li>\n  <li>but only three are holy: \"i will it!\"<\/li>\n  <li>whatever road i take, <span class='match'>the<\/span> guiding star is within me; the guiding star<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span> loadstone which point the way. they point in but one direction.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y point to me.<\/li>\n  <li>i know not if this earth on which i stand is <span class='match'>the<\/span> core of the universe<\/li>\n  <li>or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. i know not and i<\/li>\n  <li>care not. for i know what happiness is possible to me on earth. and my<\/li>\n  <li>happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. my happiness is not<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> means to any end. it is the end. it is its own goal. it is its own<\/li>\n  <li>purpose.<\/li>\n  <li>nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r am i the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. i am<\/li>\n  <li>not a tool for <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir use. i am not a servant of their needs. i am not a<\/li>\n  <li>bandage for <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir wounds. i am not a sacrifice on their altars.<\/li>\n  <li>i am a man. this miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine to<\/li>\n  <li>guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before!<\/li>\n  <li>i do not surrender my treasures, nor do i share <span class='match'>the<\/span>m. the fortune of my<\/li>\n  <li>spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to <span class='match'>the<\/span> winds as<\/li>\n  <li>alms for <span class='match'>the<\/span> poor of the spirit. i guard my treasures: my thought, my<\/li>\n  <li>will, my freedom. and <span class='match'>the<\/span> greatest of these is freedom.<\/li>\n  <li>i owe nothing to my bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, nor do i gather debts from them. i ask<\/li>\n  <li>none to live for me, nor do i live for any o<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. i covet no man's<\/li>\n  <li>soul, nor is my soul <span class='match'>the<\/span>irs to covet.<\/li>\n  <li>i am nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them<\/li>\n  <li>shall deserve of me. and to earn my love, my bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs must do more than<\/li>\n  <li>to have been born. i do not grant my love without reason, nor to any<\/li>\n  <li>chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. i honor men with my love. but<\/li>\n  <li>honor is a thing to be earned.<\/li>\n  <li>i shall choose friends among men, but nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r slaves nor masters. and i<\/li>\n  <li>shall choose only such as please me, and <span class='match'>the<\/span>m i shall love and respect,<\/li>\n  <li>but nei<span class='match'>the<\/span>r command nor obey. and we shall join our hands when we wish,<\/li>\n  <li>or walk alone when we so desire. for in <span class='match'>the<\/span> temple of his spirit, each<\/li>\n  <li>man is alone. let each man keep his temple untouched and undefiled. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n<\/li>\n  <li>let him join hands with o<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs if he wishes, but only beyond his holy<\/li>\n  <li>threshold.<\/li>\n  <li>for <span class='match'>the<\/span> word \"we\" must never be spoken, save by one's choice and as a<\/li>\n  <li>second thought. this word must never be placed first within man's soul,<\/li>\n  <li>else it becomes a monster, <span class='match'>the<\/span> root of all the evils on earth, the root<\/li>\n  <li>of man's torture by men, and of an unspeakable lie.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> word \"we\" is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to<\/li>\n  <li>stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that<\/li>\n  <li>which is black are lost equally in <span class='match'>the<\/span> grey of it. it is the word by<\/li>\n  <li>which <span class='match'>the<\/span> depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> might of the strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the<\/li>\n  <li>sages.<\/li>\n  <li>what is my joy if all hands, even <span class='match'>the<\/span> unclean, can reach into it? what<\/li>\n  <li>is my wisdom, if even <span class='match'>the<\/span> fools can dictate to me? what is my freedom,<\/li>\n  <li>if all creatures, even <span class='match'>the<\/span> botched and the impotent, are my masters?<\/li>\n  <li>what is my life, if i am but to bow, to agree and to obey?<\/li>\n  <li>but i am done with this creed of corruption.<\/li>\n  <li>i am done with <span class='match'>the<\/span> monster of \"we,\" the word of serfdom, of plunder, of<\/li>\n  <li>misery, falsehood and shame.<\/li>\n  <li>and now i see <span class='match'>the<\/span> face of god, and i raise this god over the earth, this<\/li>\n  <li>god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will<\/li>\n  <li>grant <span class='match'>the<\/span>m joy and peace and pride.<\/li>\n  <li>this god, this one word:<\/li>\n  <li>\"i.\"<\/li>\n  <li>part twelve<\/li>\n  <li>it was when i read <span class='match'>the<\/span> first of the books i found in my house that i<\/li>\n  <li>saw <span class='match'>the<\/span> word \"i.\" and when i understood this word, the book fell from<\/li>\n  <li>my hands, and i wept, i who had never known tears. i wept in deliverance<\/li>\n  <li>and in pity for all mankind.<\/li>\n  <li>i understood <span class='match'>the<\/span> blessed thing which i had called my curse. i understood<\/li>\n  <li>why <span class='match'>the<\/span> best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why i had<\/li>\n  <li>never felt guilt in my sins. i understood that centuries of chains and<\/li>\n  <li>lashes will not kill <span class='match'>the<\/span> spirit of man nor the sense of truth within<\/li>\n  <li>him.<\/li>\n  <li>i read many books for many days. <span class='match'>the<\/span>n i called the golden one, and i<\/li>\n  <li>told her what i had read and what i had learned. she looked at me and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> first words she spoke were:<\/li>\n  <li>\"i love you.\"<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n i said:<\/li>\n  <li>\"my dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names. <span class='match'>the<\/span>re was<\/li>\n  <li>a time when each man had a name of his own to distinguish him from all<\/li>\n  <li>o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men. so let us choose our names. i have read of a man who lived<\/li>\n  <li>many thousands of years ago, and of all <span class='match'>the<\/span> names in these books, his is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> one i wish to bear. he took the light of the gods and he brought it<\/li>\n  <li>to men, and he taught men to be gods. and he suffered for his deed as<\/li>\n  <li>all bearers of light must suffer. his name was prome<span class='match'>the<\/span>us.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"it shall be your name,\" said <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one.<\/li>\n  <li>\"and i have read of a goddess,\" i said, \"who was <span class='match'>the<\/span> mother of the earth<\/li>\n  <li>and of all <span class='match'>the<\/span> gods. her name was gaea. let this be your name, my golden<\/li>\n  <li>one, for you are to be <span class='match'>the<\/span> mother of a new kind of gods.\"<\/li>\n  <li>\"it shall be my name,\" said <span class='match'>the<\/span> golden one.<\/li>\n  <li>now i look ahead. my future is clear before me. <span class='match'>the<\/span> saint of the pyre<\/li>\n  <li>had seen <span class='match'>the<\/span> future when he chose me as his heir, as the heir of all the<\/li>\n  <li>saints and all <span class='match'>the<\/span> martyrs who came before him and who died for the same<\/li>\n  <li>cause, for <span class='match'>the<\/span> same word, no matter what name they gave to their cause<\/li>\n  <li>and <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir truth.<\/li>\n  <li>i shall live here, in my own house. i shall take my food from <span class='match'>the<\/span> earth<\/li>\n  <li>by <span class='match'>the<\/span> toil of my own hands. i shall learn many secrets from my books.<\/li>\n  <li>through <span class='match'>the<\/span> years ahead, i shall rebuild the achievements of the past,<\/li>\n  <li>and open <span class='match'>the<\/span> way to carry them further, the achievements which are open<\/li>\n  <li>to me, but closed forever to my bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, for their minds are shackled<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span> weakest and dullest ones among them.<\/li>\n  <li>i have learned that my power of <span class='match'>the<\/span> sky was known to men long ago;<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y called it electricity. it was the power that moved their greatest<\/li>\n  <li>inventions. it lit this house with light which came from those globes of<\/li>\n  <li>glass on <span class='match'>the<\/span> walls. i have found the engine which produced this light.<\/li>\n  <li>i shall learn how to repair it and how to make it work again. i shall<\/li>\n  <li>learn how to use <span class='match'>the<\/span> wires which carry this power. then i shall build a<\/li>\n  <li>barrier of wires around my home, and across <span class='match'>the<\/span> paths which lead to<\/li>\n  <li>my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable than a wall of<\/li>\n  <li>granite; a barrier my bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs will never be able to cross. for they<\/li>\n  <li>have nothing to fight me with, save <span class='match'>the<\/span> brute force of their numbers. i<\/li>\n  <li>have my mind.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>n here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and nothing<\/li>\n  <li>above me but <span class='match'>the<\/span> sun, i shall live my own truth. gaea is pregnant with<\/li>\n  <li>my child. our son will be raised as a man. he will be taught to say \"i\"<\/li>\n  <li>and to bear <span class='match'>the<\/span> pride of it. he will be taught to walk straight and on<\/li>\n  <li>his own feet. he will be taught reverence for his own spirit.<\/li>\n  <li>when i shall have read all <span class='match'>the<\/span> books and learned my new way, when my<\/li>\n  <li>home will be ready and my earth tilled, i shall steal one day, for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> last time, into the cursed city of my birth. i shall call to me my<\/li>\n  <li>friend who has no name save international 4-8818, and all those like<\/li>\n  <li>him, fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and solidarity 9-6347<\/li>\n  <li>who calls for help in <span class='match'>the<\/span> night, and a few others. i shall call to me<\/li>\n  <li>all <span class='match'>the<\/span> men and the women whose spirit has not been killed within them<\/li>\n  <li>and who suffer under <span class='match'>the<\/span> yoke of their brothers. they will follow me<\/li>\n  <li>and i shall lead <span class='match'>the<\/span>m to my fortress. and here, in this uncharted<\/li>\n  <li>wilderness, i and <span class='match'>the<\/span>y, my chosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall<\/li>\n  <li>write <span class='match'>the<\/span> first chapter in the new history of man.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>se are the things before me. and as i stand here at the door of<\/li>\n  <li>glory, i look behind me for <span class='match'>the<\/span> last time. i look upon the history of<\/li>\n  <li>men, which i have learned from <span class='match'>the<\/span> books, and i wonder. it was a long<\/li>\n  <li>story, and <span class='match'>the<\/span> spirit which moved it was the spirit of man's freedom.<\/li>\n  <li>but what is freedom? freedom from what? <span class='match'>the<\/span>re is nothing to take a man's<\/li>\n  <li>freedom away from him, save o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men. to be free, a man must be free of<\/li>\n  <li>his bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs. that is freedom. that and nothing else.<\/li>\n  <li>at first, man was enslaved by <span class='match'>the<\/span> gods. but he broke their chains. then<\/li>\n  <li>he was enslaved by <span class='match'>the<\/span> kings. but he broke their chains. he was enslaved<\/li>\n  <li>by his birth, by his kin, by his race. but he broke <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir chains. he<\/li>\n  <li>declared to all his bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs that a man has rights which neither god nor<\/li>\n  <li>king nor o<span class='match'>the<\/span>r men can take away from him, no matter what their number,<\/li>\n  <li>for his is <span class='match'>the<\/span> right of man, and there is no right on earth above this<\/li>\n  <li>right. and he stood on <span class='match'>the<\/span> threshold of the freedom for which the blood<\/li>\n  <li>of <span class='match'>the<\/span> centuries behind him had been spilled.<\/li>\n  <li>but <span class='match'>the<\/span>n he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage<\/li>\n  <li>beginning.<\/li>\n  <li>what brought it to pass? what disaster took <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir reason away from<\/li>\n  <li>men? what whip lashed <span class='match'>the<\/span>m to their knees in shame and submission? the<\/li>\n  <li>worship of <span class='match'>the<\/span> word \"we.\"<\/li>\n  <li>when men accepted that worship, <span class='match'>the<\/span> structure of centuries collapsed<\/li>\n  <li>about <span class='match'>the<\/span>m, the structure whose every beam had come from the thought of<\/li>\n  <li>some one man, each in his day down <span class='match'>the<\/span> ages, from the depth of some<\/li>\n  <li>one spirit, such spirit as existed but for its own sake. those men who<\/li>\n  <li>survived those eager to obey, eager to live for one ano<span class='match'>the<\/span>r, since they<\/li>\n  <li>had nothing else to vindicate <span class='match'>the<\/span>m--those men could neither carry on,<\/li>\n  <li>nor preserve what <span class='match'>the<\/span>y had received. thus did all thought, all science,<\/li>\n  <li>all wisdom perish on earth. thus did men--men with nothing to offer save<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>ir great number--lost the steel towers, the flying ships, the<\/li>\n  <li>power wires, all <span class='match'>the<\/span> things they had not created and could never keep.<\/li>\n  <li>perhaps, later, some men had been born with <span class='match'>the<\/span> mind and the courage to<\/li>\n  <li>recover <span class='match'>the<\/span>se things which were lost; perhaps these men came before the<\/li>\n  <li>councils of scholars. <span class='match'>the<\/span>y were answered as i have been answered--and<\/li>\n  <li>for <span class='match'>the<\/span> same reasons.<\/li>\n  <li>but i still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of<\/li>\n  <li>transition, long ago, that men did not see whi<span class='match'>the<\/span>r they were going, and<\/li>\n  <li>went on, in blindness and cowardice, to <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir fate. i wonder, for it is<\/li>\n  <li>hard for me to conceive how men who knew <span class='match'>the<\/span> word \"i\" could give it up<\/li>\n  <li>and not know what <span class='match'>the<\/span>y lost. but such has been the story, for i have<\/li>\n  <li>lived in <span class='match'>the<\/span> city of the damned, and i know what horror men permitted to<\/li>\n  <li>be brought upon <span class='match'>the<\/span>m.<\/li>\n  <li>perhaps, in those days, <span class='match'>the<\/span>re were a few among men, a few of clear sight<\/li>\n  <li>and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word. what agony must<\/li>\n  <li>have been <span class='match'>the<\/span>irs before that which they saw coming and could not stop!<\/li>\n  <li>perhaps <span class='match'>the<\/span>y cried out in protest and in warning. but men paid no heed<\/li>\n  <li>to <span class='match'>the<\/span>ir warning. and they, these few, fought a hopeless battle, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>y perished with their banners smeared by their own blood. and they<\/li>\n  <li>chose to perish, for <span class='match'>the<\/span>y knew. to them, i send my salute across the<\/li>\n  <li>centuries, and my pity.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span>irs is the banner in my hand. and i wish i had the power to tell them<\/li>\n  <li>that <span class='match'>the<\/span> despair of their hearts was not to be final, and their night<\/li>\n  <li>was not without hope. for <span class='match'>the<\/span> battle they lost can never be lost. for<\/li>\n  <li>that which <span class='match'>the<\/span>y died to save can never perish. through all the darkness,<\/li>\n  <li>through all <span class='match'>the<\/span> shame of which men are capable, the spirit of man will<\/li>\n  <li>remain alive on this earth. it may sleep, but it will awaken. it may<\/li>\n  <li>wear chains, but it will break through. and man will go on. man, not<\/li>\n  <li>men.<\/li>\n  <li>here on this mountain, i and my sons and my chosen friends shall build<\/li>\n  <li>our new land and our fort. and it will become as <span class='match'>the<\/span> heart of the earth,<\/li>\n

<li>will become as veins which will carry <span class='match'>the<\/span> best of the world's blood to<\/li>\n  <li>my threshold. and all my bro<span class='match'>the<\/span>rs, and the councils of my brothers, will<\/li>\n  <li>hear of it, but <span class='match'>the<\/span>y will be impotent against me. and the day will come<\/li>\n  <li>when i shall break all <span class='match'>the<\/span> chains of the earth, and raze the cities of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>the<\/span> enslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where each<\/li>\n  <li>man will be free to exist for

### Creating functions

We want to create functions so we can reuse the code easily, on any book.

We can separate our process in two steps:

1.  Importing and cleaning the data
2.  Analysing the data

Let's start with the function to import and clean up a book:

``` r
import_clean <- function(file) {
  book <- readLines(file)
  start <- str_which(book, "START OF TH") + 1
  end <- str_which(book, "END OF TH") - 1
  book <- book[start:end]
  book <- str_to_lower(book)
}
```

#### Challenge N

##### Instructions

There's one more step missing: removing the empty strings. Can you add it to the function?

##### Solution

``` r
import_clean <- function(file) {
  book <- readLines(file)
  start <- str_which(book, "START OF TH") + 1
  end <- str_which(book, "END OF TH") - 1
  book <- book[start:end]
  book <- str_to_lower(book)
  book <- book[book != ""]
}
```

#### 

Let's test our function:

``` r
JaneEyre <- import_clean("data/CharlotteBronte_JaneEyre.txt")
```

Now, let's create the function that analyses the data. It needs to output a list that contains our stats:

``` r
book_stats <- function(book) {
  characters <- sum(str_length(book))
  words <- sum(str_count(book, "\\w+"))
  lines <- length(book)
  results <- list(char_count = characters,
                  word_count = words,
                  line_count = lines)
  results
}
```

#### Challenge N

##### Instructions

We've got the characters, the words and the lines. How would you add the search term data to your function?

##### Solution

``` r
book_stats <- function(book, search_term) {
  characters <- sum(str_length(book))
  words <- sum(str_count(book, "\\w+"))
  lines <- length(book)
  terms <- sum(str_count(book, search_term))
  results <- list(char_count = characters,
                  word_count = words,
                  line_count = lines,
                  term_count = terms)
  results
}
```

#### 

Let's test our second function on the book we just imported:

``` r
book_stats(JaneEyre, "love")
```

    ## $char_count
    ## [1] 1009326
    ## 
    ## $word_count
    ## [1] 189462
    ## 
    ## $line_count
    ## [1] 16397
    ## 
    ## $term_count
    ## [1] 235

### Loop through all files

We will now use our functions on all our files, and store the data into a dataframe. But to save us some typing, we will use a loop.

First, let's create an empty dataframe:

``` r
data <- data.frame()
```

Then, let build our `for` loop. We want to add an extra variable in there: the name of the file the data comes from.

``` r
for (filename in list.files("data")) {
  book <- import_clean(paste0("data/", filename))
  results <- book_stats(book, "love")
  results <- append(list(file = filename), results)
  data <- rbind(data, results, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}
```

After executing our loop, we can visualise our dataset with:

``` r
View(data)
```

### Create new variables

`dplyr` is a useful package to manipulate data.

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

### Visualise

`ggplot2` is a useful package to manipulate data.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data,
       aes(x = reorder(file, love_score),
           y = love_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(c(0, NA))
```
