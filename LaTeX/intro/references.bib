	abstract = {There is increasing focus on greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural systems. One suggested method for increasing the sequestration of carbon (C) within agricultural soils is to increase crop productivity and therefore C input into the soil. However, if enhanced production is achieved via nitrogenous fertilisers, there is a potential tradeoff between decreased C emissions and increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the increased soil C and nitrogen (N). An alternative is to incorporate leguminous crops into cereal cropping rotations to provide a biological source of N. However, the likely production of N2O from N released during the decomposition of leguminous residues is unknown as is the impact on C input into the soil when some cereal crops are replaced with grain legumes. Consequently, an analysis of the likely impacts has been undertaken for a subtropical dryland cropping system in Queensland, Australia where soil, climate and management are conducive to denitrification losses.

A series of scenarios embracing a range of cropping rotations, N fertilisers and leguminous crops was tested using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The model configuration was tested using long term data from the Brigalow Catchment Study site near Theodore, Queensland, Australia (24.81°S, 149.80°E). A wide range of data was used in testing the model for the major terms in the C, N and water balances.

Scenario analyses of alternative management systems including the use of fertiliser or legume grain or forage crops within cereal rotations demonstrated that soil C can be managed to some degree via simple changes in agronomic practice. The use of legumes within cereal rotations was not always as effective in reducing N2O emissions as improved fertiliser practice. For example, replacing wheat with chickpea did not reduce N2O emission relative to fertilised systems and did not assist in increasing soil C due to impacts on stubble cover over the important summer months. The fact that some interventions proved counterproductive due to complex feedback mechanisms highlights the need for detailed models which capture the links between water, C, N and management.},

This study used the 15N stable isotope technique, under controlled laboratory conditions, to quantify the interactive effect on and relative contributions of the component species to N2O emission and mineral N dynamics in a tropical luvisol incorporated with different rates of cowpea-maize residue mixtures. The results show that increasing the maize residue proportion in the mixture significantly decreases N2O emission compared to the sole cowpea incorporation but increases mineral N concentration compared to sole maize residue incorporation.

The soils covered the different climates of Europe and included four different land-use types: croplands, forests, grasslands and wetlands. In a two-factorial experimental design, the soil cores were incubated under four temperatures (5–20°C) and water contents (20–80\% water-filled pore space). We found a non-linear increase of N2O, NO and CO2 emissions with increasing temperature. Nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with soil moisture, while NO emission and CH4 oxidation rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture. Maximum CO2 emissions occurred at intermediate soil moisture. Different land-use types strongly affected greenhouse gas fluxes. Nitrous oxide and CO2 emissions were highest in grassland soils, while NO emissions were highest in forest soils. In grasslands, high soil microbial activity stimulated by high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, dense root systems and high C input from above-ground decaying biomass was the most likely cause for high N2O and CO2 emissions. High NO emissions from forest soils were mainly attributed to low pH and high soil porosity. Northern soils showed the greatest capacity to take up CH4 under warmer and dryer soil conditions. Nitric oxide emissions were positively correlated with N input.},

More recently, two ABA transporters in the nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter (NRT1/PTR) family have been identified. In this review, we discuss the role of these different ABA transporters and examine the scientific impact of their identification. Given that the NRT1/PTR family is involved in the transport of nitrogen (N) compounds, further work should determine whether an interaction between ABA and N signaling or nutrition occurs.},

Two of the NRT1 genes, CHL1 and AtNRT1.2, and two of the NRT2 genes, AtNRT2.1 and AtNRT2.2, are known to be involved in nitrate uptake. In addition, AtNRT1.4 is required for petiole nitrate storage.

In barley, HvPTR1, expressed in the plasma membrane of scutellar epithelial cells, is involved in mobilizing peptides, produced by hydrolysis of endosperm storage protein, to the developing embryo. In higher plants, there is another family of peptide transporters, called oligopeptide transporters (OPTs), which transport tetra/pentapeptides.

	abstract = {Background
Nitrogen uptake, reallocation within the plant, and between subcellular compartments involves ammonium, nitrate and peptide transporters. Ammonium transporters are separated into two distinct families (AMT1 and AMT2), each comprised of five members on average in angiosperms. Nitrate transporters also form two discrete families (NRT1 and NRT2), with angiosperms having four NRT2s, on average. NRT1s share an evolutionary history with peptide transporters (PTRs). The NRT1/PTR family in land plants usually has more than 50 members and contains also members with distinct activities, such as glucosinolate and abscisic acid transport.

Results
Phylogenetic reconstructions of each family across 20 land plant species with available genome sequences were supplemented with subcellular localization and transmembrane topology predictions. This revealed that both AMT families diverged prior to the separation of bryophytes and vascular plants forming two distinct clans, designated as supergroups, each. Ten supergroups were identified for the NRT1/PTR family. It is apparent that nitrate and peptide transport within the NRT1/PTR family is polyphyletic, that is, nitrate and/or peptide transport likely evolved multiple times within land plants. The NRT2 family separated into two distinct clans early in vascular plant evolution. Subsequent duplications occurring prior to the eudicot/monocot separation led to the existence of two AMT1, six AMT2, 31 NRT1/PTR, and two NRT2 clans, designated as groups.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic separation of groups suggests functional divergence within the angiosperms for each family. Distinct groups within the NRT1/PTR family appear to separate peptide and nitrate transport activities as well as other activities contained within the family, for example nitrite transport. Conversely, distinct activities, such as abscisic acid and glucosinolate transport, appear to have recently evolved from nitrate transporters.},

	abstract = {Aim

Our aims were to identify centres of endemism and to infer whether these areas have functioned as refugia for subtropical rain forest plants through historical climate fluctuations.


Location

Subtropical eastern Australia (23–33° S; 145–155° E).


Methods

We collated 25,000 records of 179 endemic rain forest plants to identify geographical areas with unusually high concentrations of endemic taxa and range-restricted endemics. We then tested whether centres of endemism coincide with other features indicating refugia, including habitat stability over 120,000 years, and we related dispersal patterns to past habitat stability using seed weight as a surrogate for dispersal ability of endemic plant taxa.


Results

We identified five main centres of endemism. Historical stability and other processes affecting diversity, including current rainfall, rain forest area, and topographic complexity, explained 58\% of variation in plant-weighted endemism. Taxa with poor dispersal ability were concentrated in the areas that were most stable historically.


Main conclusions

Several lines of evidence suggest that centres of endemism have functioned as important refugia for subtropical rain forest taxa through historical climate fluctuations. The highest concentrations of range-restricted endemic species occur in locations that are predicted to have maintained stable rain forest habitat over at least the past 120,000 years. This association was independent from other factors that were expected to promote diversity (i.e. rain forest area and current environmental suitability). These locations have disproportionately high concentrations of species with poor dispersal ability (large-seeded species).},

High nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates aimed at increasing yield often result in environmental damage because of excess and inefficient application. Inoculation with diazotrophic bacteria is an attractive option for reducing N fertilizer needs. However, the efficacy of bacterial inoculants is variable, and their effective formulation remains a knowledge frontier. Here, we take a new approach to investigating diazotrophic bacteria associated with roots using culture-independent microbial community profiling of a commercial sugarcane variety (Q208A) in a field setting. We first identified bacteria that were markedly enriched in the rhizosphere to guide isolation and then tested putative diazotrophs for the ability to colonize axenic sugarcane plantlets (Q208A) and promote growth in suboptimal N supply. One isolate readily colonized roots, fixed N2 and stimulated growth of plantlets, and was classified as a new species, Burkholderia australis sp. nov. Draft genome sequencing of the isolate confirmed the presence of nitrogen fixation. We propose that culture-independent identification and isolation of bacteria that are enriched in rhizosphere and roots, followed by systematic testing and confirming their growth-promoting capacity, is a necessary step towards designing effective microbial inoculants.},

Focusing on two biomes, rainforest and wetlands in biodiverse South East Queensland, Australia, we demonstrate how general principles can be translated into specific actions for stakeholders and responsible agencies. We synthesize research that is contextualizing protection of refugia and habitat connectivity, establishing baseline data sets to detect change and developing strategic conservation planning scenarios to adjust reserve boundaries or situate new reserves. This has been achieved by coupling spatial information on biological assets (i.e. ecosystems and species) with future climate scenarios and process models to anticipate movement of critical habitats. Conservation planning software is also being used to prioritize investment to meet specific objectives. This approach is enabling us to identify at-risk biological assets, opportunities to ameliorate threats and obstacles to delivering regional adaptation actions. A larger total reserved area is needed, with proactive planning to capture areas further inland and along watercourses. Major obstacles include conflict between urbanization and priorities for habitat conservation and the need for greater levels of investment for monitoring programmes and to protect landward shifted wetlands on private land.},

	abstract = {Mixed ley crops including legumes are important in agriculture, giving high quality forage as well as adding N to the cropping system. These leys are also increasingly being used as green manure crops. Due to the large N2 fixing capacity of the leguminous crops the N input is large, causing large internal N flows in the ley systems. Nitrogen budgets are thus intricate but important for evaluation of the N efficiency and environmental footprint of the production systems including mixed leys. Three field experiments were established on sandy soils during three consecutive years. Total quantities of N fixed symbiotically by red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) in pure and mixed (with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)) stands, including N transferred to the grass, were determined under different cutting regimes. Estimates of N transfer from red clover to ryegrass were derived through (a) dilution of 15N label in microplots of immobilised 15N-labelled soil, and (b) recovery of 15N label by direct transfer from leaf-labelled clover plants in mezotrons. The estimated all-season amount of N transferred from red clover to ryegrass determined from isotope dilution was 0.7–6.8 g m−2, with no significant differences between intact and harvested stands, but mulched stands had more transferred N than harvested stands during the last growth period. All-season N transfer corresponded to an average of 30 and 57\% of grass N (in harvested and intact stands, respectively) and 13 and 26\% of clover N (in harvested and intact stands, respectively) with an increasing proportion being transferred successively during the growing season. The estimated amounts of N transferred from leaf-labelled clover to the companion ryegrass were 0.4–4.7 g m−2, i.e. somewhat lower than the isotope dilution estimates. This N corresponded to approximately 16\% of grass N and 15\% of clover N, irrespective of cutting strategy. The discrepancy between results obtained by the two methods was attributed to leaf fall being prevented in the direct transfer plots, but not in the dilution-based estimates. In addition, the mulch in plots for direct transfer estimates was replaced with non-labelled mulch, whereas the ‘native’ mulch was left in the plots for estimation through dilution. The N transfer contributed strongly to the N budget of the companion ryegrass, especially in the stands where leaf fall contributed to the transfer. The uptake of clover-derived N by a companion grass may have implications for ley composition and feeding value as well as for the effects of mixed green manure and catch crops in agriculture.},

	abstract = {Adopting mixtures of legumes and non-legumes can be an efficient tool to merge the advantages of the single species in the fall-sown cover crop practice. Cover crop mixtures are supposed to provide an additional benefit in reducing N leaching risks as compared to pure legume thanks to the N trapping skill of the non-legume companion, but to our knowledge no data are available on the effect of mixed cover crops on N leaching. For this reason, in a three-year study we investigated the effect of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) grown in 100\% pure stands or in 50:50 mixtures on the N leaching below the rooting zone as compared to the bare soil. The NO3-N concentration in the soil solution was monitored by suction cup lysimeters placed at 0.9 m depth during the whole growing cycle and after cover crop incorporation into the soil and the amount of leached N was calculated on the basis of estimated drainage.
The mixture showed variable biomass accumulation and proportion in the biomass accumulated by companion species across years, but a rather constant N accumulation, with a biomass C/N ratio intermediate between those of the pure crops. In all years, the N trapping effect of the mixture was clear as it decreased NO3-N leaching at the same level of pure barley, both during its own growing cycle and after cover crop incorporation into the soil. Pure vetch showed the highest N source potential as green manure but no NO3-N leaching mitigation effect as compared to the bare soil. Thus we demonstrate here that a mixture of barley and vetch, which was already known to be a “self-buffered system” able to guarantee a good and rather stable N accumulation, is also a “buffering system” for the agroecosystems in the Mediterranean conditions by acting as a N trapping crop able to reduce N leaching.},

	abstract = {Inclusion of forage legumes in low-input forage mixtures improves herbage production and soil fertility through addition of nitrogen (N) from N2-fixation. The impact of different grass–legume mixtures on the N contribution of the forage mixture has rarely been investigated under comparable soil and climatic conditions. We conducted a field experiment on a sandy soil at two nitrogen levels with seven two-species forage mixtures: alfalfa, bird's-foot trefoil, red clover, or white clover in mixture with perennial ryegrass, and white clover in mixture with meadow fescue, timothy, or hybrid ryegrass. We found high N2-fixation of more than 300 kg N ha−1 from both red clover and alfalfa even when the two mixtures received 300 kg total-N ha−1 in cattle slurry. The addition of cattle slurry N fertilizer lowered N2-fixation for white clover and red clover as expected, but for bird's-foot trefoil and alfalfa no changes in the proportion of N derived from N2-fixation was observed. We conclude that the competition for available soil N from perennial ryegrass in mixture was an important factor for the proportion of N in alfalfa, white clover, and bird's-foot trefoil obtained from N2-fixation. White clover had a high proportion of N derived from atmosphere for all companion grasses despite significant differences in white clover proportion. Although the perennial ryegrass–alfalfa mixture in the grass phase yielded more than twice the N from N2-fixation compared to white clover in the perennial ryegrass mixture, this did not in the following year lead to higher residual N effects of alfalfa. Both in terms of N yield in the grass phase and N yield in the subsequent spring barley red clover contributed most to the improvement of soil N fertility.},

Focusing on two biomes, rainforest and wetlands in biodiverse South East Queensland, Australia, we demonstrate how general principles can be translated into specific actions for stakeholders and responsible agencies. We synthesize research that is contextualizing protection of refugia and habitat connectivity, establishing baseline data sets to detect change and developing strategic conservation planning scenarios to adjust reserve boundaries or situate new reserves. This has been achieved by coupling spatial information on biological assets (i.e. ecosystems and species) with future climate scenarios and process models to anticipate movement of critical habitats. Conservation planning software is also being used to prioritize investment to meet specific objectives. This approach is enabling us to identify at-risk biological assets, opportunities to ameliorate threats and obstacles to delivering regional adaptation actions. A larger total reserved area is needed, with proactive planning to capture areas further inland and along watercourses. Major obstacles include conflict between urbanization and priorities for habitat conservation and the need for greater levels of investment for monitoring programmes and to protect landward shifted wetlands on private land.},

Location Subtropical eastern Australia (23–33° S; 145–155° E). Methods We collated 25,000 records of 179 endemic rain forest plants to identify geographical areas with unusually high concentrations of endemic taxa and range-restricted endemics. We then tested whether centres of endemism coincide with other features indicating refugia, including habitat stability over 120,000 years, and we related dispersal patterns to past habitat stability using seed weight as a surrogate for dispersal ability of endemic plant taxa. Results We identified five main centres of endemism. Historical stability and other processes affecting diversity, including current rainfall, rain forest area, and topographic complexity, explained 58\% of variation in plant-weighted endemism. Taxa with poor dispersal ability were concentrated in the areas that were most stable historically. Main conclusions Several lines of evidence suggest that centres of endemism have functioned as important refugia for subtropical rain forest taxa through historical climate fluctuations. The highest concentrations of range-restricted endemic species occur in locations that are predicted to have maintained stable rain forest habitat over at least the past 120,000 years. This association was independent from other factors that were expected to promote diversity (i.e. rain forest area and current environmental suitability). These locations have disproportionately high concentrations of species with poor dispersal ability (large-seeded species).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2005.01.017},
	abstract = {A literature review was undertaken to assess current knowledge on how root system growth and function influences sugarcane productivity. Sugarcane root systems are commonly depicted as comprising highly branched superficial roots, downward-oriented buttress roots and deeply penetrating agglomerations of vertical roots known as rope roots. It is unclear how common rope systems are in modern sugarcane cultivars. Root distributions for sugarcane show the expected exponential decline with depth, with maximum values for root length density as high as 5 cm cm−3. Observations from the 1930s suggested maximum root depth could exceed 6 m and there is evidence of root activity below 2 m, from use of 32P as a tracer and observed changes in soil water content. There is little information available on root turnover in sugarcane, but evidence shows that the root system is not completely replaced when ratooning occurs. The below-ground C budget for sugarcane is very poorly understood and, consequently, C allocation and the ‘energy cost’ of the sugarcane root system is unknown. Hydraulic properties for root systems have been determined with considerable variation in conductivities found among the few varieties for which measurements have been made. Stomatal and root hydraulic conductances are correlated in sugarcane, for both pot and field-grown crops, resulting in approximately homeostatic regulation of leaf water potential. Available evidence indicates that stomatal response to root water status is achieved by transmission of a chemical signal in xylem sap, suggesting root water status may affect assimilation. Models and management need to acknowledge this, particularly for example where parts of the root system are in compacted or dry soil. Extraction of water and nutrients from depth should also be addressed, to improve utilisation of available resources and reduce the risk of off-site impacts. It is possible that improvements in yield through breeding have come at the expense of roots and capacity for water and nutrient uptake, and therefore old and new cultivars should be compared to determine if selection programs are causing application efficiencies (uptake per unit of resource applied) for water and nutrients to decline.},

	abstract = {This paper provides information on the effects on soil chemical properties of using filter mud [filter cake] and/or boiler ash, based on 'paired sites' from 33 locations in Queensland and NSW canelands (Australia). Concentrations of nutrients and contaminant heavy metals in soils where these byproducts have been used were typically within ranges reported in other surveys of canelands. The exception was P, where high loading rates well in excess of immediate crop requirements, have raised acid extractable soil P levels (up to 1260 mg/kg). This alone is sufficient reason to change the current recycling practice both from an environmental as well as an economic viewpoint. It is estimated that it will take 4-5 applications of filter mud to raise soil total P concentrations at sites with no history of filter mud usage to comparable levels found at sites with long-term usage. A benefit from using these byproducts is an increase in soil pH levels (in some cases up to 1.5 pH units), particularly on light textured soils, with concomitant reductions in exchangeable acidity and percent aluminium saturation. While soil total cadmium loadings also increased with byproduct use, reductions in calcium chloride extractable cadmium suggest the increase in soil pH may reduce the plant available cadmium fraction. Changes in management practices affecting soil pH, and other relevant soil properties, will need to be considered particularly when other more sensitive food crops are grown on these soils.},

In females, all treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls, the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by GMO and Roundup treatments. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5–5.5 times higher. This pathology was confirmed by optic and transmission electron microscopy. Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3–2.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600 days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76\% of the altered parameters were kidney related. These results can be explained by the non linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, but also by the overexpression of the transgene in the GMO and its metabolic consequences.},

	abstract = {Since 1980’s, NJF members from Nordic and Baltic countries have been engaged in research, development and extension work in organic farming and food systems. Several NJF seminars have been arranged to highlight organic food and agriculture, bringing together experts from different branches of sience, from ecology to economics. This seminar in Denmark 2013 is part of this chain of seminars, which started in Alnarp, Sweden 2005 and was followed by Tartu, Estonia in 2009. This seminar is organized in collaboration with ICROFS - International Centre for Research in Organic Food Systems and EPOK - Centre for Organic Food and Farming at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

 Organic agriculture has grown to a sector with profound impact on the societal and agricultural development. Hence, we want to utilize the upcoming seminar to reveal how organic research has contributed, or may contribute to change the many and serious challenges that we face to protect our environment and to ensure a satisfactory living for all. Concurrently, the needs for improvement in practical farming systems, both to support the farmers and to further develop organic farming in a sustainable direction, must be emphasized.

 The objective of the seminar is to encourage the seminar participants to discuss relevant main challenges and how research and developmental work can be more efficiently directed to solve problems in organic farming systems, based on the overview of work presented during the seminar. The seminar should inspire the participants, and make them better equipped to utilize their work to solve problems in relation to (organic) farming, as they are challenged to reflect the impact of their work in a broader context. 

The seminar program is arranged around the following four tracks:
 1. Societal and economic viability
 2. Transition to renewable resources 
 3. Nutrient sufficiency and management in farming systems 
 4. Productivity and sustainable production levels in animal and crop production

 Download the final programme to see the topics that will be covered in these tracks. 
 
Keynote speakers 
Opening speech "Organic farming meets future food and environmental challenges" will be given by Elisabeth Gauffin, Sweden, a dairy farmer and the president of KRAV - Swedish Association for Standards in Organic Agriculture and Food.

 There are four track experts and each of them will give an introductory key-note speech about major challenges related to the respective track:

 Track 1: "The organic sector as an innovation system" by Dr. Susanne Padel, Principal socio-economic researcher, The Organic Research Centre, Elm Farm, UK.

 Track 2: "Energy balance comparisons of organic and conventional farming systems and potentials for the mitigation of fossil resource use" by Dr. Tommy Dalgaard, Head of Agro-Environmental Management MSc Programme, Department of Agroecology, Aarhus University, Denmark.

 Track 3: "Long-term management of nutrients in organic farming - principles and practice" by Dr. Christine Watson, Leader of the Soils Research Team, Scotland's Rural College, UK.

 Track 4: "Is agroeclogy the most suitable approach for all organic farming systems? by Prof. Paolo Bàrberi, Professor of Agronomy and Field Crops, Institute of Life Sciences, Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, Italy.

 The track experts have participated in planning the programme and will contribute to discussions in the sessions and take part in the final plenary session in summing up major conclusions.},

Respondents were predominantly from the United States, Canada and the UK. Seventy per cent were female, and ages ranged from 14 to 53 years, with a median of 26 years. These data are interrogated within a theoretical framework that asks, ‘what can a vegetarian body do?’ and explores the physical, psychic, social and conceptual relations of participants. This provides insights into the identities of participants, and how diet and identity interact. It is concluded that vegetarianism is both a diet and a bodily practice with consequences for identity formation and stabilisation.},

	abstract = {A model of nutrient uptake was used to determine the factors that control the uptake of ammonium, glycine, and nitrate for an important arctic sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, because the factors that regulate the nitrogen (N) uptake of plants in natural ecosystems are not well understood and a growing number of studies suggest that organic forms of N, including glycine, are an important source of N for E. vaginatum and other plants. E. vaginatum was selected as an exemplary system to explore nitrogen (N) uptake of a native species in situ, because it appears to be strongly N limited in the field, its N nutrition has been extensively studied, and its root growth habits make it well suited to modeling nutrient uptake. The model accounts for N supply from microbial mineralization and other sources, flux of N through the soil to the root surface, and uptake by the plant root. We included glycine in our simulations of N uptake because laboratory experiments have shown that E. vaginatum can use glycine and other low-molecular-mass amino acids as a source of N. However, the extent to which glycine contributes to the N nutrition of E. vaginatum in the field is unknown. Based on these simulations we find that: (1) Ammonium, glycine, and nitrate could all potentially make significant contributions to the N nutrition of E. vaginatum. The relative contribution of glycine is difficult to assess, because its behavior in the soil has not been characterized. However, glycine and ammonium contributed in roughly equal proportions for most model parameterizations. (2) The importance of factors that regulated modeled ammonium and glycine uptake can be ranked as follows: supply rate {\textgreater} [soil factors (buffer capacity and diffusion coefficient) = root density] {\textgreater} root uptake kinetics. Supply rate was the only factor that regulated nitrate uptake. These simulation results and other considerations suggest that N uptake kinetics of roots and soil-solution concentrations may not be reliable predictors of whole-plant N uptake in tundra or other natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is being lost from sugarcane soils following application to the crop. This study was conducted to estimate the quantity of N being lost from the soil through biological denitrification and to determine the proportion of gaseous N being emitted either as N2O or as N2. Field studies were conducted on four different soils (humic gley, alluvial massive earth, red earth and gleyed podzolic), and on different crop management systems, by installing plastic (PVC) cylinders (23.5 cm diam., 25 cm long) in the soil to a depth of 20 cm beside the plant row in a ratoon sugarcane crop. 15N-labelled KNO3 was applied as a band across each cylinder to a depth of 2.5 cm at a rate of 160 kg N/ha. After rainfall or irrigation, the cylinders were capped for 3 h intervals and gas in the headspace sampled in the morning and afternoon, for up to 4 days. Denitrification losses from the humic gley ranged from 247 g N/ha.day for cultivated plots to 1673 g N/ha.day for no-till plots. Over the sampling period, this was equivalent to 3.2\% and 19.7\% of the N applied, respectively. Nitrous oxide accounted for 46\% to 78\% of the total N lost. For the alluvial, massive earth and the red earth and gleyed podzolic, losses over the sampling period ranged from 25 to 117 g N/h.day and represented \&lt;1\% of the N applied. Recovery of 15N in the soil ranged from 67\% at the first sampling on the red earth soil to 4.9\% at the third sampling on the alluvial, massive earth soil. In a glasshouse study, intact soil cores (23.5 cm diam., 20 cm long), taken from the humic gley and the alluvial, massive earth, were waterlogged after band application of 15N-labelled KNO3 at a rate of 160 kg N/ha. Gas samples from the headspace were taken after 3 h, and then morning and afternoon for the next 14 days. Denitrification losses ranged from 13.2 to 38.6\% of N applied with the majority of gaseous N loss occurring as N2. Total recoveries after 14 days, including the evolved gases, ranged from 68.7 to 88.2\%. We conclude that denitrification is a major cause of fertilizer N loss from fine-textured soils, with nitrous oxide the major gaseous N product when soil nitrate concentrations are high.},

	issn = {1680-7316},
	abstract = {The relationship, on a global basis, between the amount of N fixed by chemical, biological or atmospheric processes entering the terrestrial biosphere, and the total emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), has been re-examined, using known global atmospheric removal rates and concentration growth of N2O as a proxy for overall emissions. For both the pre-industrial period and in recent times, after taking into account the large-scale changes in synthetic N fertiliser production, we find an overall conversion factor of 3-5\% from newly fixed N to N2O-N. We assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production systems. It is covered only in part by the default conversion factor for "direct" emissions from agricultural crop lands (1\%) estimated by IPCC (2006), and the default factors for the "indirect" emissions (following volatilization/deposition and leaching/runoff of N: 0.35-0.45\%) cited therein. However, as we show in the paper, when additional emissions included in the IPCC methodology, e.g. those from livestock production, are included, the total may not be inconsistent with that given by our "top-down" method. When the extra N2O emission from biofuel production is calculated in "CO2-equivalent" global warming terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of "saving" emissions of fossil fuel derived CO2, the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as much or more to global warming by N2O emissions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate impacts. This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass to biofuel. It does not take into account the use of fossil fuel on the farms and for fertilizer and pesticide production, but it also neglects the production of useful co-products. Both factors partially compensate each other. This needs to be analyzed in a full life cycle assessment.},

	abstract = {The Australian sugar industry is moving away from the practice of burning the crop before harvest to a system of green cane trash blanketing (GCTB). Since the residues that would have been lost in the. re are returned to the soil, nutrients and organic matter may be accumulating under trash blanketing. There is a need to know if this is the case, to better manage fertiliser inputs and maintain soil fertility. The objective of this work was to determine whether conversion from a burning to a GCTB trash management system is likely to affect soil fertility in terms of C and N. Indicators of short- and long-term soil C and N cycling were measured in field experiments in contrasting climatic conditions. The effects of GCTB varied among experiments. Experiments that had been running for 1-2 years (Harwood) showed no significant trash management effects. In experiments that had been running for 3-6 years (Mackay and Tully), soil organic C and total N were up to 21\% greater under trash blanketing than under burning, to 0.10 or 0.25mdepth (most of this effect being in the top 50 mm). Soil microbial activity (CO2 production) and soil microbial biomass also increased under GCTB, presumably as a consequence of the improved C availability. Most of the trash C was respired by the microbial biomass and lost from the system as CO2. The stimulation of microbial activity in these relatively short- term GCTB systems was not accompanied by increased net mineralisation of soil N, probably because of the greatly increased net immobilisation of N. It was calculated that, with standard fertiliser applications, the entire trash blanket could be decomposed without compromising the supply of N to the crop. Calculations of possible long-term effects of converting from a burnt to a GCTB production system suggested that, at the sites studied, soil organic C could increase by 8-15\%, total soil N could increase by 9-24\%, and inorganic soil N could increase by 37 kg/ha. year, and that it would take 20-30 years for the soils to approach this new equilibrium. The results suggest that fertiliser N application should not be reduced in the first 6 years after adoption of GCTB, but small reductions may be possible in the longer term ({\textgreater} 15 years).},

	abstract = {Sugarcane in Australia is increasingly grown under the green cane trash blanket system where harvest residues ( trash) are retained on the soil surface instead of being burnt. This is considered a more sustainable system, but relatively little is known about its effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). As part of a study to understand the effects of trash retention on soil C and N dynamics, we measured the composition and decomposition of sugarcane trash in terms of dry matter (DM), C, and N in 5. eld experiments in contrasting climatic conditions in Queensland and New South Wales. The trash from newly harvested sugarcane contained large quantities of DM (7-12 t/ha) and C (3-5 t/ha), which could be estimated from cane yield, and significant quantities of N (28-54 kg/ha), which could not be predicted from cane yield. Trash quality was low (C : N ratio {\textgreater} 70) and it took a year for most of the trash to decompose. Cumulative thermal time was the variable most closely associated with cumulative DM and C decomposition. Variation in the rate of trash DM and C decomposition between sampling dates was partially related to temperature and rainfall at 2 of the 3 sites, but was considered to be influenced by other factors (such as soil, trash, and management) as much as by climate. There were 2 phases of decomposition: an early phase when C : N ratios were high and variable and net N loss or gain was not related to C loss; and a late phase when C : N ratios were much lower and similar across experiments and net N loss was related to C loss. The rate of N loss from trash during the first 12 months was slow (1 - 5 kg/ month), which would have been of little immediate significance for plant growth. The potential value of trash for soil N supply lies in cumulative effects over the medium-long term.},

	abstract = {Sustainable production is becoming an increasingly important issue in the process industries. In the cane sugar industry, pressure for sustainable production has come largely from the importers of ethanol from sugarcane. This has focused attention on sustainable production in the sugar industry in general. Some of the major producers of white sugar are aware of the advantages in the market place of sustainable manufacturing processes in terms of brand enhancement and are using the low carbon footprint of sugar to their advantage. This paper aims to introduce the main elements of sustainability and the major sustainability issues facing producers. The estimation of the carbon footprint for raw and refined sugar production is described and the aspects of production affecting greenhouse gas emissions are identified. Opportunities for refiners in terms of reducing the carbon footprint of their products and the implications are described. Attempts to certify production as sustainable have led to the need for formal certifiable sustainability standards in the sugar industry. The process of developing credible sustainability standards is described. Substantial progress has been made in this respect by the Better Sugar Cane Initiative (now referred to as Bonsucro) in the development of standards for the certification of sustainable production, paving the way for auditing and certification in 2011.},

	abstract = {Climate change is rapidly becoming a serious issue and one which will increasingly demand the attention of sugar producers. Estimation of the greenhouse gas emissions in the production of sugar, otherwise known as the carbon footprint, is an essential part of any sustainability study. A method of estimating net energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions has been developed, based initially on work done on biofuels. The calculation routine was developed for use in the Better Sugarcane Initiative standards, which focus on the sustainability of the sugarcane industry. This estimation procedure estimates primary energy requirements including both direct effects, mainly energy usage, and indirect effects, which include energy used in the production of fuels, fertilizers and chemicals. Allowance is also made for the inclusion of direct land use change effects. The estimation procedure allows for the production of molasses and/or ethanol, and for the export of power. Attention is given to the potential errors and problems in arriving at these estimates. The main problems are uncertainties in emissions from fertilizer use and the way in which emissions are allocated to co-products. The results show that the carbon footprint is most affected by sugarcane yield, sugar recovery, fertilizer usage, irrigation, cane burning and power export. A factory set up efficiently for maximum power generation can show a negative carbon footprint and, in this respect, maximum export of electric power can deliver a lower carbon footprint than maximum ethanol production. The calculation routine estimates the greenhouse gas emissions from field to factory gate and can be used for an existing operation or in the design of a new project to assist in making good sustainability choices.

	abstract = {THIS paper reports the results of a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of
sugarcane production and processing in Queensland. The work is part of an
ongoing postgraduate research project examining the environmental implications
of alternative sugarcane production systems for the Queensland sugar industry.
The results presented in the paper show the life-cycle impact of producing a
tonne of raw cane sugar in Queensland, for a range of environmental impact
categories: energy input, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication and water
use. Results are presented for three scenarios: a ‘State average’ farming system
as well as two fairly distinct cane growing regions, the Burdekin and the Wet
Tropics. These results highlight the significant aspects associated with sugar
production in Australia. They also show the range in variation present in the
industry due to different growing conditions. To put the environmental impact of
cane sugar production into perspective, sugarcane is compared with other starch-
and sugar-bearing crops, sugar beet and corn. Cane sugar is shown to have
distinct advantages in relation to energy input, greenhouse gas emissions, and
land utilisation, but does not rate as well in relation to other the impacts assessed
(eutrophication and water use). Three factors were found to have the strongest
influence on the outcome: agricultural yield, nitrogen emissions, and the
environmental ‘credits’ attributed to co-products. The paper provides further
insight into the environmental impacts of cane-sugar production in Australia,
and suggests opportunities for improving the environmental profile of the cane
industry in this country. These include maximising the environmental ‘credits’
from co-products, optimising nitrogen inputs, mitigating nitrogen losses, and
continuing with water efficiency efforts.},

wastes and emissions. A number of scenarios considered the utilisation of
mill by-products from existing sugarcane processing (ethanol from
molasses, electricity from bagasse, and ethanol from bagasse). These
were found to result in some significant environmental gains, reducing
non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). These
benefits come with few trade-offs. Of the three by-product utilisation
scenarios, electricity generation from bagasse provided the best gains if
all impacts are considered. Other scenarios considered expanded cane
growing for production of ethanol and PLA plastics from cane juice.
These scenarios yielded very high gains in non-renewable energy use and
GHG emissions, but came with trade-offs–the additional environmental
impacts of expanded agricultural production (land use, water use and
potential water quality impacts).},

The recently developed CaneLCA Eco-efficiency Calculator was employed to compare
progressive practices against conventional practices for Wet Tropics, Central and

many progressive practices, such as those currently described by the ABCD framework,
can lead to improved environmental efficiency across all impact categories. However,
others may come with some environmental trade-offs. This work provides a preliminary
examination of the environmental implications of practice change. It also demonstrates
how CaneLCA can be used to understand and manage such trade-offs so that practice

	abstract = {NEW MARKET DRIVERS are currently being implemented to stimulate additional
investment in technologies and energy sources which result in reduced greenhouse gas
emissions. In addition there is a rising demand from stakeholders and customers for
information about the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of products (carbon
footprint). This paper describes the development and use of a software tool that
significantly reduces the time and effort required to undertake a detailed carbon
footprint, based on life cycle assessment (LCA), for sugar and energy products from
sugar milling co-processes. The tool takes the form of an EXCEL-based template into
which data relating to the production of raw sugar, refined sugar, electricity and ethanol,
is entered. The template is used to undertake material and energy balance calculations to
produce data that can be used to conduct a full carbon footprint using commercially
available LCA software. The tool enables a rapid and consistent LCA evaluation of
multiple scenarios relating to farming, harvest and transport practice, factory
configuration, co-process integration strategies and the impact of extraneous fuels on
the embodied emissions of cane products. The results of case studies undertaken using
this tool for two contrasting cane production regions and co-processes are reported.},

	abstract = {A COMPARISON of the environmental impacts of organic and conventional
sugarcane growing in Queensland has been undertaken using environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). The aim of the assessment was to provide initial insight
into the comparative environmental performance of organic and conventional
cane growing as currently practised in Queensland. The assessment used primary
data from cane farms in the Rocky Point and Mackay canegrowng areas that
participated in a recent RIRDC-funded project to investigate the fledgling organic cane industry, data from cane production models, as well as simulated agronomic data from the APSIM crop modelling tool. This paper reports results
for energy input, greenhouse gas emissions, acidification potential and eutrophication potential. The results show that, for the impact categories of
energy input and greenhouse gas emissions, there is no significant difference between the two systems. The energy avoided by not using synthetic fertilisers and chemicals is offset by the more intensive use of machinery and the transport of low-density nutrient sources in organic systems. However, growing organic cane may provide greenhouse gas benefits if the expected lower levels of denitrification are taken into consideration. Organic growing can provide benefits in relation to water quality and eco-toxicity due to the elimination of inorganic fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides. The lower yields currently being achieved from organic cane, due to conversion of the system, have a significant
influence on the overall environmental burden per tonne of cane. However, if
yields were to increase to levels comparable with conventional cane due to improvements in soil health and nutrient levels, this would improve the
environmental performance of organic systems relative to conventional systems.},

	abstract = {Changes in agricultural practices with time have led to a decline in soil structure and with it, an increase in soil-borne plant diseases. Agricultural practices such as incorporating organic amendments and managing the type and quantity of crop residue, have a direct impact on plant health and crop productivity. Soil management practices involving tillage, rotation, and burning will impact the amount and quality of organic matter that is returned to the soil. These practices influence pathogen viability and distribution, nutrient availability, and the release of biologically active substances from both crop residues and soil microorganisms as illustrated by the model system of Cochliobolus sativus on the development of common root rot in cereals. The application of organic amendments, manures and composts that are rich in nitrogen, may reduce soil-borne diseases by releasing allelochemicals generated during product storage or by subsequent microbial decomposition. The modes of action for disease suppression are elucidated for a number of diseases including verticillium wilt and common scab of potato. Developing disease suppressive soils by introducing organic amendments and crop residue management takes time, but the benefits accumulate across successive years improving soil health and structure.},

measurable benefits to people. Reviews of this topic have generally focused on a specific

particular type of interaction. Here we construct novel typologies of the settings,
interactions and potential benefits of people-nature experiences, and use these to organise
an assessment of the benefits of interacting with nature. We discover that evidence for the
benefits of interacting with nature is geographically biased towards high latitudes and
Western societies, potentially contributing to a focus on certain types of settings and
benefits. Social scientists have been the most active researchers in this field. Contributions
from ecologists are few in number, perhaps hindering the identification of key ecological
features of the natural environment that deliver human benefits. Although many types of
benefits have been studied, benefits to physical health, cognitive performance and
psychological well-being have received much more attention than the social or spiritual
benefits of interacting with nature, despite the potential for important consequences arising
from the latter. The evidence for most benefits is correlational, and although there are
several experimental studies, little as yet is known about the mechanisms that are important
for delivering these benefits. For example, we do not know which characteristics of natural
settings (e.g., biodiversity, level of disturbance, proximity, accessibility) are most
important for triggering a beneficial interaction, and how these characteristics vary in importance among cultures, geographic regions and socio-economic groups. These are key
directions for future research if we are to design landscapes that promote high quality

High genetic diversity of Nitrosospira-like sequences was found in the limed soil profiles, whereas no AOB-like sequences were detected in the control soil at any depth, according to both the SSCP and DGGE analyses. This clearly showed that liming induced growth of a diverse flora of AOB at this forest site. Both Nitrosospira cluster 2 and cluster 4 sequences were present in the limed soil profiles, regardless of soil pH, but we found a higher number of sequences affiliated with cluster 4. The high lime dose seemed to affect the AOB community more than the low dose, and its effects reached deeper into the soil profile.

Uniformly 13C-labeled Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) and alder (Alnus cremastogyne) leaf litter with or without 100 mg NH4+ or NO3− were added to the soil. The purpose was to investigate the influence of N availability on the decomposition of the litter and native SOC. The production of CO2, the natural abundance of 13C–CO2, and the inorganic N dynamics were monitored. The results showed that Chinese fir (with a high C:N ratio) and alder (with a low C:N ratio) leaf litter caused significant positive priming effects (PEs) of 24\% and 42\%, respectively, at the end of the experiment (235 d). The PE dynamics showed that positive PE can last for at least 87 d. However, the possible occurrence of a significant negative PE with a sufficient incubation period is difficult to confirm. The application of both NH4+ and NO3− was found to have a stimulating effect on the decomposition of Chinese fir and alder leaf litter in the early stage (0–15 d) of incubation, but an adverse effect in the late stage. Compared with NO3−, NH4+ caused a greater decrease in the PE induced by both Chinese fir and alder leaf litter. The effects of NH4+ and NO3− on the PE dynamics had different patterns for different incubation stages. This result may indicate that the stability or recalcitrance of SOC, especially in such plantation forest soils, strongly depends on available leaf litter and application of N to the soil.},

	doi = {10.2307/2657230},
	abstract = {The consequences of permanent loss of species or species groups from plant communities are poorly understood, although there is increasing evidence that individual species effects are important in modifying ecosystem properties. We conducted a field experiment in a New Zealand perennial grassland ecosystem, creating artificial vegetation gaps and imposing manipulation treatments on the reestablishing vegetation. Treatments consisted of continual removal of different subsets or "functional groups" of the flora. We monitored vegetation and soil biotic and chemical properties over a 3-yr period. Plant competitive effects were clear: removal of the C(3) grass Lolium perenne L. enhanced vegetative cover, biomass, and species richness of both the C(4) grass and dicotyledonous weed functional groups and had either positive or negative effects on the legume Trifolium repens L., depending on season. Treatments significantly affected total plant cover and biomass; in particular, C(4) grass removal reduced total plant biomass in summer, because no other species had appropriate phenology. Removal of C(4) grasses reduced total root biomass and drastically enhanced overall shoot-to-root biomass ratios. Aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) was not strongly affected by any treatment, indicating strong compensatory effects between different functional components of the flora. Removing all plants often negatively affected three further trophic levels of the decomposer functional food web: microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, and predaceous nematodes. However, as long as plants were present, we did not find strong effects of removal treatments, NPP, or plant biomass on these trophic groupings, which instead were most closely related to spatial variation in soil chemical properties across all trophic levels, soil N in particular. Larger decomposer organisms, i.e., Collembola and earthworms, were unresponsive to any factor other than removal of all plants, which reduced their populations. We also considered five functional components of the soil biota at finer taxonomic levels: three decomposer components (microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, predaceous nematodes) and two herbivore groups (nematodes and arthropods). Taxa within these five groups responded to removal treatments, indicating that plant community composition has multitrophic effects at higher levels of taxonomic resolution. The principal ordination axes summarizing community-level data for different trophic groups in the soil food web were related to each other in several instances, but the plant ordination axes were only significantly related to those of the soil microfloral community. There were time lag effects, with ordination axes of soil-associated herbivorous arthropods and microbial-feeding nematodes being related to ordination axes representing plant community structure at earlier measurement dates. Taxonomic diversity of some soil organism groups was linked to plant removals or to plant diversity. For herbivorous arthropods, removal of C(4) grasses enhanced diversity; there were negative correlations between plant and arthropod diversity, presumably because of negative influences of C(4) species in the most diverse treatments. There was evidence of lag relationships between diversity of plants and that of the three decomposer groups, indicating multitrophic effects of altering plant diversity. Relatively small effects of plant removal on the decomposer food web were also apparent in soil processes regulated by this food web. Decomposition rates of substrates added to soils showed no relationship with treatment, and rates of CO(2) evolution from the soil were only adversely affected when all plants were removed. Few plant functional-group effects on soil nutrient dynamics were identified. Although some treatments affected temporal variability (and thus stability) of soil biotic properties (particularly CO(2) release) throughout the experiment, there was no evidence of destabilizing effects of plant removals. Our data provide evidence that permanent exclusion of plant species from the species pool can have important consequences for overall vegetation composition in addition to the direct effects of vegetation removal, and various potential effects on both the above- and belowground subsystems. The nature of many of these effects is driven by which plant species are lost from the system, which depends on the various attributes or traits of these species.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSoil ecosystems harbor the most complex prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on Earth. Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of ∼98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO2 fixation.Conclusions/SignificanceThis approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods.},

It was found that both types of humic acids increased either NH4 + or NO2 – oxidation and cell growth of nitrifying bacteria in a dose-independent manner. By combining these results with data from a comparative growth evaluation of N. agilis based on possible utilization of humates or pyruvate in heterotrophic conditions, evidence was obtained that nitrifiers cannot use humic acids as an alternative carbon and energy source. Thus, the stimulating effect of this fraction of soil organic matter on chemolithotrophic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers might be attributed to an increase in microbial membrane permeability favouring a better utilization of nutrients.},

	abstract = {The assumed relationship between biodiversity or local richness and the persistence of ‘ecosystem services’ (that can sustain productivity on-site as well as off-site, e.g. through regulation of water flow and storage) in agricultural landscapes has generated considerable interest and a range of experimental approaches. The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity–function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed ‘functional threshold’. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity–function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or ‘utilitarian’ benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic (‘option’ or ‘bequest’) values or utilitarian (‘direct use’) than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users.},

This paper discusses the soil health improvements that are being obtained with this new farming system, particularly its beneficial effects on soil carbon levels and soil biological properties. It also summarises research showing that breaking the sugarcane monoculture with a soybean or peanut crop reduces populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root- knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica), the two most important nematode pests of sugarcane. The role of minimum tillage and inputs of organic matter in enhancing the natural biological control mechanisms that suppress these nematodes is also discussed. The paper then considers the farming system currently used for vegetable crops such as tomato, capsicum and rockmelon, where inadequate crop rotation, excessive tillage, low organic inputs and the fallowing and solarisation effect of covering beds with plastic leads to a situation where soil fumigation is seen as the only option for reducing losses from soilborne pests and pathogens. Since the sugar industry coexists with the vegetable industry in some areas of Australia, the paper argues the case for developing minimum tillage practices for vegetable production and integrating them into the sugarcane farming system. It concludes that a farming system of this nature would improve profitability in both industries, produce better environmental outcomes at a landscape level and provide more sustainable solutions to nematode and soilborne disease problems.},

The straw was incorporated into the top layer at 0–5 cm depth and into the bottom layer at 15–20 cm depth of a sandy or a loamy soil. Microbial biomass C was significantly increased after adding straw to the bottom layer of both soils. After adding straw to the top layer, this increase was significantly lower in the sandy soil and significantly higher in the loamy soil. Maize straw application significantly increased the ergosterol-to-microbial biomass C ratio in both soils from 0.26\% to a mean content of 0.72\% after adding straw to the top layer and to a mean content of 1.11\% after adding straw to the bottom layer. The calculation of the maize-derived CO2 production revealed that the mineralization rates of maize C were always higher in the sandy soil, with a mean of 20\%, than in the loamy soil, with a mean of 14\%. The application of maize straw always significantly increased the soil organic matter-derived CO2 production. This increase was stronger in the loamy soil than in the sandy soil and stronger after application of the maize straw to the top layer than to the bottom layer. On average, 100\% of the maize straw C was recovered in the different fractions analysed. In the layers with maize leaf straw application, 28\% of the maize C was recovered as particulate organic matter (POM) \&gt; 2 mm and 32\% as POM 0.4–2.0 mm, without a significant difference between the two soils and the depth of application. In the layers with maize leaf straw application, 19\% of the maize C was recovered as microbial residue C and 3.1\% as microbial biomass C. In the three layers without straw, the microbial biomass incorporated a further 2.4\% of the maize C in the sandy soil, but only 0.9\% in the loamy soil. Considerable amounts of substrate C were transferred within the microbial biomass over a decimetre distance. The finer pore space of the loamy soil seems to obstruct the transfer of maize-derived C. This was especially true if the maize leaf straw was added to the bottom layer.},

	title = {Trash management - consequences for soil carbon and nitrogen},
	abstract = {The effects of sugarcane trash management (burnt or green cane trash blanketing [GCTB]) on indicators of short- and long-term soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling were investigated. The burnt and GCTB systems were compared in 5 field experiments in Australia at 3 locations with different climates. Soil and trash were sampled eight to 10 times over one (12-month) season in each experiment. At the time of this study, the experiments had been running for between one and six years. Under GCTB, trash containing 7-12 t dry matter/ha, 3000-5000 kg C/ha, and 30-60 kg N/ha was deposited on the soil surface at harvest. Most of the dry matter ({\textgreater}85\%) was decomposed during the subsequent 12 months. In the oldest experiments, 3-6 years of GCTB increased total N, organic C and microbial biomass C in the soil. These changes were largely restricted to the upper 20 or 50 mm. In the youngest experiments, 1-2 years of GCTB had no effect on total or microbial C and N levels. Short-term laboratory incubations of soil showed that microbial respiration was greater under GCTB, particularly in the older experiments. Concomitant net mineralization of N, however, generally did not differ significantly between trash management treatments. The ratio (C mineralization:N mineralization) indicated greater immobilization of N in GCTB than in burnt soils. The effect of GCTB on soil properties increased with increasing cumulative returns of C and N. Approximately 10-20\% of cumulative C returns were measured as soil organic C and 40-100\% of cumulative N returns measured as total soil N. Measured rates of decomposition and accumulation of C and N were combined with assumptions about the mineralization of C and N in trash left from previous years, and calculated equilibrium C and N balances for two soils that differed in total C and N. These calculations suggested that GCTB could cause soil organic C to increase by 1.5-14\% and soil total N to increase by 1.5-21\% in the top 250 mm of these soils. The increases in total C and N and time to equilibrium were highly dependent on the rate of trash decomposition.},

	abstract = {Crop management practices can affect the soil microbial community, but it is not clear whether the effect of these practices is measurable at the wheat root-soil interface, where the plant exerts significant influence through root exudation. In this study, wheat plants were grown in soil amended with milled canola, lucerne, lupin, pea, and wheat residues with and without lime, to determine what changes occur to microbial community structure in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere soil collected from wheat plants at the 5-leaf stage was assessed for overall microbial functional diversity using BIOLOG analysis and the diversity of the functional gene nifH using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and cloning. Plant development was reduced in all residue amendments except lucerne, and a high positive correlation in the non-limited treatments between plant residue nitrogen (N) content and wheat shoot N suggested microbial competition for available N. Results from BIOLOG analysis indicated significant differences in rhizosphere microbial community structure due to lime, and to a lesser extent, residue type. Diversity, measured by the Shannon Diversity Index, was higher in limed rhizosphere soil, in addition to an increase in soils amended with lucerne, lupin, and pea residues compared with amendment with wheat, canola, and control soil. Each residue amendment promoted unique microbial communities determined by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) of the BIOLOG data; the strongest effect was produced by addition of canola residues. N-fixing bacteria were also affected by lime, but residue effects were less apparent, especially between limed samples. The factor that correlated best with both BIOLOG and nifH T-RFLP data in non-limed soil was a combination of residue sodium (Na), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn). In limed soil, phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and pH correlated well with BIOLOG data, and N, potassium ( K), and iron (Fe) correlated with nifH T-RFLP data. A clone library of nifH sequences from control and limed, pea-amended soils revealed significant diversity amongst nifH sequences, most clustering with alpha-proteobacteria, and in some instances with Geobacter sulfurreducens. Clone distribution was significantly different for control soil and pea/lime soil, especially amongst the alpha-proteobacteria. The results suggest that rhizosphere microorganisms can be influenced by soil amendments, and change, depending on the type of residue applied. The addition of lime, however, produced the most significant changes in microbial community structure and nifH-containing rhizobacteria, highlighting the significant functional changes that occur when soil pH is increased.},

	abstract = {Organic fertilizers may differ greatly in composition and as a result there may also be differences in nitrogen oxides emissions following their application to soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mineral and organic N fertilizers on the nitrification and denitrification processes, and consequently on N2O and NO emissions. Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha−1. Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha−1 for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha−1, for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25\% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78\% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32\% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56\% (CPS + U) and 85\% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased N2O emission by 27\%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55\% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O in comparison with urea.},

	abstract = {Soil is the largest reservoir of carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and a slight variation in this pool could lead to substantial changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, thus impact significantly on the global climate. Cultivation of natural ecosystems has led to marked decline in soil C storage, such that conservation agricultural practices (CAPs) are widely recommended as options to increase soil C storage, thereby mitigating climate change. In this review, we summarise soil C change as a result of cultivation worldwide and in Australia. We then combine the available data to examine the effects of adopting CAPs on soil C dynamics in Australian agro-ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future research priorities related to soil C dynamics. The available data show that in Australian agro-ecosystems, cultivation has led to C loss for more than 40 years, with a total C loss of approximately 51\% in the surface 0.1 m of soil. Adoption of CAPs generally increased soil C. Introducing perennial plants into rotation had the greatest potential to increase soil C by 18\% compared with other CAPs. However, the same CAPs could result in different outcomes on soil C under different climate and soil combinations. No consistent trend of increase in soil C was found with the duration of CAP applications, implying that questions remain regarding long-term impact of CAPs. Most of the available data in Australia are limited to the surface 0.1 to 0.3 m of soil. Efforts are needed to investigate soil C change in deeper soil layers in order to understand the impact of crop root growth and various agricultural practices on C distribution in soil profile. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, global warming and rainfall change could all alter the C balance of agricultural soils. Because of the complexity of soil C response to management and environmental factors, a system modelling approach supported by sound experimental data would provide the most effective means to analyse the impact of different management practices and future climate change on soil C dynamics.},

In addition, soil microbial respiration was higher in soils from organic than sustainable or conventional farms, indicating that microbial activity was greater in these soils. Populations of fungi and thermophiles were significantly higher in soils from organic and sustainable than conventional fields. The diversity of bacterial functional communities was also greater in soils from organic farms, while species diversity was similar. Soils from organic and sustainable farms had improved soil health as indicated by a number of soil physical, chemical and biological factors and reduced disease.},

Bacteria are responsible for diverse metabolic functions that affect soil and plant health. Nutrient cycling, organic matter formation and decomposition, soil structure formation, and plant growth promotion are among the beneficial functions that bacteria perform. Deleterious effects include plant disease promotion. As bacterial functioning is critical to soil and plant health, the objective of this manuscript was to explore bacterial diversity and bioindication in agroecosystems. Microbial research has generally involved studying bacteria that are culturable. However, it is estimated that only a small portion of all bacteria are culturable, a vast portion of soil bacterial communities remains unstudied. With molecular techniques, more information can be obtained about those bacteria that are contributing to ecosystem functioning and are viable, but not culturable. Enhancing knowledge of soil bacterial functioning and diversity will aid in the development of sustainable agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {The densely populated, intensively cropped subtropical highlands of the world have agricultural sustainability problems from soil erosion and fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31°N, 98.50°W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions. Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG™ ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2 and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg−1dry soil and 515 mg C kg−1dry soil, respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg−1dry soil) compared to maize (319 mg C kg−1dry soil). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg−1dry soil) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG™ ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value compared to the other treatments, AWCD of maize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. In the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that leads to poor soil health in the long run.},

	abstract = {* 1Soil science and ecology have developed independently, making it difficult for ecologists to contribute to urgent current debates on the destruction of the global soil resource and its key role in the global carbon cycle. Soils are believed to be exceptionally biodiverse parts of ecosystems, a view confirmed by recent data from the UK Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope, Scotland, where high diversity was a characteristic of small organisms, but not of larger ones. Explaining this difference requires knowledge that we currently lack about the basic biology and biogeography of micro-organisms. * 2It seems inherently plausible that the high levels of biological diversity in soil play some part in determining the ability of soils to undertake ecosystem-level processes, such as carbon and mineral cycling. However, we lack conceptual models to address this issue, and debate about the role of biodiversity in ecosystem processes has centred around the concept of functional redundancy, and has consequently been largely semantic. More precise construction of our experimental questions is needed to advance understanding. * 3These issues are well illustrated by the fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizas, the Glomeromycota. This ancient symbiosis of plants and fungi is responsible for phosphate uptake in most land plants, and the phylum is generally held to be species-poor and non-specific, with most members readily colonizing any plant species. Molecular techniques have shown both those assumptions to be unsafe, raising questions about what factors have promoted diversification in these fungi. One source of this genetic diversity may be functional diversity. * 4Specificity of the mycorrhizal interaction between plants and fungi would have important ecosystem consequences. One example would be in the control of invasiveness in introduced plant species: surprisingly, naturalized plant species in Britain are disproportionately from mycorrhizal families, suggesting that these fungi may play a role in assisting invasion. * 5What emerges from an attempt to relate biodiversity and ecosystem processes in soil is our extraordinary ignorance about the organisms involved. There are fundamental questions that are now answerable with new techniques and sufficient will, such as how biodiverse are natural soils? Do microbes have biogeography? Are there rare or even endangered microbes?},

Soil was treated with single large additions of organic C compounds (asparagine, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, mannose, methyl–glucamine and urocanic acid) or repeated additions of compounds (asparagine, glucosamine, α-ketovaleric acid or urocanic acid) over 4 d. The effects on microbial functional diversity were assessed by measurement of patterns of in situ catabolic potential (ISCP) in each experiment at 1, 7 and 20 weeks, and 1, 4 and 7 d, respectively. Microbial biomass C was generally increased by the substrate additions in both experiments and remained greater than the control over 7 d in the repeated-addition experiment. After 20 weeks, however, only the microbial biomass C in the asparagine and mannose treatments remained increased in the single-addition experiment. The direction of changes in the patterns of ISCP were distinctly different between most treatments in both the single- and repeated-substrate addition experiments. Over 20 weeks, factor analysis showed that the patterns of ISCP in the glutamic acid, mannose, methyl–glucamine and urocanic acid treatments tended to converge with that in the non-amended treatment. The changes in patterns of ISCP were also different after repeated additions of different substrates. However, respiration responses to the added substrate in each of the treatments were not specifically increased relative to the respiration responses to other organic C compounds. These results support the hypothesis that addition of different types of organic C can influence patterns of ISCP. However, it is difficult to distinguish the direct effects of the added compounds on the respiration response to individual substrates.},

Soils are the central organizing entities in terrestrial ecosystems and possess extremely diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic biota. They are physically and chemically complex, with micro- and macro-aggregates embedded within a solid, liquid and gaseous matrix that is continually changing in response to natural and human-induced perturbations. Recent advances in molecular techniques in systematics have provided opportunities for the study of biodiversity and biocomplexity of soil biota. A symposium and workshop on soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity International Symposium on Impacts of Soil Biodiversity on Biogeochemical Processes in Ecosystems, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, Taipei, Taiwan April 18-24, 2004. Convened an international array of participants working in biomes on virtually every continent on the planet (ranging from polar to tropical regions). This special issue reports on the theoretical bases and applications of molecular methods for the measurement of soil biodiversity. 
 
Themes addressed include a melding of classical taxonomic investigations with biochemical fingerprinting and molecular probing of organism identities. Several papers highlight new advances in identifications of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Examples include new developments in “fingerprinting” of microbes active in “mycorrhizospheres” using immunocapture and other innovative techniques. Developments in the study of impacts of invasive plant and animal species on ecosystem function and subsequent microbial community composition and function have been very great in the last 2-3 years. Soils are major repositories of legacies, including fine and coarse woody debris and other organic products, which have feedbacks on soil diversity. The ways in which species diversity and function of microbial and faunal communities interact and their importance to ecosystem function are examined in biological and biochemical detail. This paper provides an overview of soil biodiversity and its feedbacks on soil biogeochemical processes in ecosystems.},

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different amounts of soybean stubble, under different soil moisture contents, on gaseous nitrogen (N) losses by denitrification from an agricultural soil. The following soil moisture treatments were reached by adding distilled water to soil cores of a typic Hapludoll: 50 and 100\% of water‐filled porosity space (WFPS). Residue treatments included no application of residues, amendment with 2600 kg ha−1 of soybean residues, and amendment with 5200 kg ha−1 of soybean residues. Cumulative nitrous oxide + dinitrogen (N2O + N2) emissions displayed great variability, ranging between 0 and 581.91 µg N kg−1, which represented 0 to 3.93\% of the N residue applied. Under 50\% WFPS moisture conditions, statistical differences in cumulative N2O + N2 emissions between residue treatments were not detected (p = 0.21), whereas at saturation conditions, cumulative N2O + N2 emissions decreased with the application of increasing amounts of soybean residues (p = 0.017). Daily and cumulative N2O + N2 emissions significantly increased as soil moisture increased, except at soils amended with 5200 kg ha−1 of soybean residues; this lack of statistical difference was probably due to the immobilization of native mineral N. Under 50\% WFPS soil moisture contents, aeration seemed to be the main factor controlling redox conditions, limiting the denitrification process, and preventing differences in N emissions between residue treatments. The application of soybean residues to saturated soils notably decreased N2O + N2 emissions by denitrification through a strong mineral N immobilization into organic and nondenitrifiable forms.},

However, for many animal by-products approved by organic farming regulations little is known about their effects on the greenhouse gas balance of the soil, in particular on N2O emissions. In this work we report on the N2O and CO2 emissions from six animal-derived wastes (horn and hoof meal, blood meal, hydrolysed leather, meat bone meal, chicken manure and a commercial organic mixed fertiliser). We compared these emissions to those from a mineral fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) in a sandy and a loam soil during a three month laboratory incubation study. N2O flux dynamics varied strongly with residue category and soil type. In the sandy soil, cumulative N2O emissions correlated with soil NO3− content. Although the mineral fertiliser produced the highest total N2O emissions (5.7 mg N2O–N kg− 1 soil), the commercial organic fertiliser mixture led to statistically similar emissions (5.3 mg N2O–N kg− 1 soil). The other by-products emitted between 1.3–3.0 mg N2O–N kg− 1 soil, and only blood meal emitted less than 1 mg N2O–N kg− 1 soil. In the loam soil, N2O emissions never exceeded 1.0 mg N2O–N kg− 1 soil, and did not correlate with NO3− in soil. With regard to CO2 emissions and C storage potential, chicken manure was the only residue that significantly accumulated C in both soils during the course of our experiment. The addition of an extra easily available source of C (glucose) or N (NO3−) influenced N2O emissions differently depending on the residue applied. Our results showed that despite the extra amount of C added with the organic amendments, N2O emissions from animal-derived wastes were never higher than those from the mineral fertiliser.},

	abstract = {The most modern molecular approaches fail to link structure of soil microbial community with its functions. We used classical physiological approaches based on (i) microbial growth kinetics and (ii) microbial affinity to the substrate to show the shift in functional properties of the soil microbial community after amendments with substrates of contrasting availability. Kinetic parameters of substrate-induced respiration and substrate availability in soil were monitored during the growth of maize, and decomposition of glucose or maize straw. Input of small amounts of easily available substrates (i.e. glucose or root exudates) significantly increased the specific growth rates of soil microorganisms by up to 13 and 20\%, respectively. This increase, showing the shift from K to r strategies, was confirmed by a 50\% decrease in the affinity of microorganisms to the easily available substrates. In contrast, maize straw lowered specific growth rates by 16–30\% and increased the affinity of microorganisms to the substrate by 23–131\% compared with untreated soil. After maize straw addition, the shift of the microbial community to K strategy was accompanied by an increase in the fraction of microbial biomass responding to glucose addition by immediate growth. The generation time of this fraction was 1.8 to 2.8 hours, which was 100 to 1000 times faster than that of the whole microbial community. Easily available carbon (C) in soil amended with maize straw comprised only half of that extracted by 0.05 m K2SO4. Therefore, we conclude that C extracted by 0.05 m K2SO4 from the soil with maize straw residues had a lower availability for microorganisms as compared with glucose. Adding N to the soil prolonged the intensive mineralization period of plant residues, decreased specific microbial growth rates and increased the amount of easily available C in the soil. This indicates a more efficient use of maize residues by K-selected microorganisms after the removal of N limitation. Combination of two complementary physiological approaches based on microbial growth kinetics and substrate affinity showed contrasting effects of easily and less available substrates on the shift of growth strategies (r vs. K) of the whole microbial community. These approaches are also suitable for estimation of microbial availability of indigenous C in the soil.},

We compared the relative susceptibility to management of microbial community metabolism with a number of soil organic matter (OM) and microbial parameters currently used as indicators of changes in soil biological quality. Following long-term cereal cropping, plots were subjected to a 16-month treatment period consisting of either a mixed cropping sequence of vetch, spring barley and clover or a continuous grass-clover ley which was periodically mown and mulched. The treatments had no effect on soil biomass N or respiration of microbial populations inoculated into Biolog Gram negative (GN) plates. After 16 months there were no management-induced changes to total OM, light-fraction OM C and N, labile organic N or water-soluble carbohydrates. However, patterns of substrate utilization by the soil microbial population following inoculation into Biolog GN plates were found to be highly sensitive to management practice. In the mixed cropping sequence, substrate utilization changed markedly following plough-in of the vetch crop, with a smaller change occurring after harvesting of the barley. In the ley treatment, substrate utilization was not affected until the onset of mowing, when the pattern changed to become similar to that in the mixed cropping sequence. Metabolic diversity of the Biolog-culturable microbial population was increased by the ley treatment, but was not affected by the cropping sequence. We conclude that patterns of microbial substrate utilization and metabolic diversity are more sensitive to the effects of management than are OM and biomass pools, and therefore have value as early indicators of the impacts of management on soil biological properties, and hence soil quality.},

	abstract = {The grain and sugarcane industries are the dominant cropping enterprises in Australia. Both are facing similar problems in maintaining productivity and profitability, although the management practices employed to achieve these objectives in the two industries differ markedly. The farming systems of both industries have evolved in recent years as our understanding of the physical and chemical benefits of practices like residue retention, reduced tillage and controlled traffic have improved. However the impact of such practices is often evaluated in terms of cost savings, operational efficiencies and efficient capture and use of water. Soil health has not always been an important consideration in system change in either industry, with the exception that crop rotation has always been recognised as important in minimising the impact of soil-borne pathogens. Rotations have been a key feature of grain cropping systems and short duration legume fallows are becoming more prevalent in the sugar industry after more than 25 years of monocultures. However, intensification of cropping in recent years has meant that the pasture leys that were once a dominant component of the grain rotation systems are increasingly being supplanted by short duration cropping breaks with grain legume or other non-cereal crops. Soil organic C has generally been recognised as an important component of soil fertility, but more for the role it plays in soil physical and chemical fertility. Links between organic matter status and soil biological health, and particularly to farming system viability and sustainability, have proven difficult to quantify. This has been partly due to a lack of tools or criteria for monitoring relevant soil properties and also to our limited understanding of the interactions between soil health and other system components. However recent studies are suggesting that the amount and quality of organic matter returned as roots and residues, and the placement of that residue relative to areas of future crop root activity, may be significant factors in the sustainable farming systems of the future. This paper identifies key issues associated with current and developing farming systems in the grain and sugar industries in Australia, and assesses the impact of management practices employed in those systems on soil health. It also identifies some key challenges facing soil biologists and farming systems researchers who are trying to achieve improvements in soil health and sustainability.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in understanding the biological mechanisms that regulate carbon exchanges between the land and atmosphere, and how these exchanges respond to climate change. An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle–climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land–atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land–atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

	abstract = {In southern Europe (Italy), a two-site field experiment with contrasting soil conditions (high clay-SOC-protecting soil near Napoli versus low clay-non-SOC-protecting soil near Torino) was conducted to evaluate the short-term potential of a carbon (C) friendly management to sustain and possibly increase both crop yields and soil organic C (SOC). Compost distribution (COM1, COM2) and minimum tillage (MT) were compared to conventional management (CONV) in a maize-based cropping system. COM1, MT, and CONV each received 130 kg N ha(-1) in compost or urea form. A double dose was applied to COM2 while the plowed control plots (ON) were not fertilized. Fertilizers were applied for three years (from 2006 to 2008); residual soil fertility was assessed during the fourth year (2009). Results suggested that only the SOC protection strategy via MT could be agronomically sustainable in the high clay content soil near Napoli. There, a short-term SOC increase was recorded with either compost or MT application. In fact, in the same soil, compost use depressed both yield and N availability for maize, which we attribute to the reduction of SOM mineralization due to hydrophobic protection by added humified organic matter coupled with soil physical protection. Compost addition increased SOC (55.1\% of added C) in the soil near Torino, where high native N availability buffered its low mineralization and allowed high yields. Alternatively, MT showed no effect on short-term C dynamics, probably because the low organic matter protection favored oxidation and mineralization of root-derived C. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The long-term effects of conservation management practices on greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical/subtropical croplands remain to be uncertain. Using both manual and automatic sampling chambers, we measured N2O and CH4 fluxes at a long-term experimental site (1968–present) in Queensland, Australia from 2006 to 2009. Annual net greenhouse gas fluxes (NGGF) were calculated from the 3-year mean N2O and CH4 fluxes and the long-term soil organic carbon changes. N2O emissions exhibited clear daily, seasonal and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement over multiple years for obtaining temporally representative annual emissions. Averaged over 3 years, annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized and fertilized soils (90 kg N ha−1 yr−1 as urea) amounted to 138 and 902 g N ha−1, respectively. The average annual N2O emissions from the fertilized soil were 388 g N ha−1 lower under no-till (NT) than under conventional tillage (CT) and 259 g N ha−1 higher under stubble retention (SR) than under stubble burning (SB). Annual N2O emissions from the unfertilized soil were similar between the contrasting tillage and stubble management practices. The average emission factors of fertilizer N were 0.91\%, 1.20\%, 0.52\% and 0.77\% for the CT-SB, CT-SR, NT-SB and NT-SR treatments, respectively. Annual CH4 fluxes from the soil were very small (−200–300 g CH4 ha−1 yr−1) with no significant difference between treatments. The NGGF were 277–350 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 for the unfertilized treatments and 401–710 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 for the fertilized treatments. Among the fertilized treatments, N2O emissions accounted for 52–97\% of NGGF and NT-SR resulted in the lowest NGGF (401 kg CO2-e ha−1 yr−1 or 140 kg CO2-e t−1 grain). Therefore, NT-SR with improved N fertilizer management practices was considered the most promising management regime for simultaneously achieving maximal yield and minimal NGGF.},

	abstract = {The rational for the launching of the Alcohol Program from sugarcane in Brazil in the mid-1970’s is described as an answer to the first “oil crisis” as well as a solution to the problem of the fluctuating sugar prices in the international market. The technical characteristics of ethanol as a fuel are given as well as a discussion of the evolution of the cost of production, environmental and social consequences. Regarding costs, ethanol production was close to 100 dollars a barrel in the initial stages of the Program in 1980 falling rapidly due to economies of scale and technological progress to half that value in 1990, followed by a slower decline in recent years. Considering the hard currency saved by avoiding oil importation through the significant displacement of gasoline by ethanol and the decrease in the amount of external debt that the displaced oil importation was able to provide it is possible to demonstrate that the Alcohol Program has been an efficient way of exchanging dollar debt by national currency subsidies which are paid by the liquid fossil fuel users. Even with this economic gains for society, the continuity of the Program is difficult to maintain. Two solutions to this problem are discussed: internal expansion of the use of ethanol and exports to industrialized countries where it could be used as an octane enhancer. The main attractiveness of the Program – the reduction of CO2 emissions as compared to fossil fuels – is stressed, mainly as a solution for industrialized countries to fulfill their commitments with the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention.},

This study aims for further investigating the short-term effects of different FYM levels on maize plants and soil parameters. Maize plants grown in pot culture were treated with no FYM (control), recommended NPK (inorganic fertilisers), FYM at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 t ha−1 along with recommended NPK, and analysed 8 weeks after germination. Soil bulk density and soil pH decreased with the increasing levels of FYM, whereas soil porosity, soil organic matter (SOM), soil water content, plant height, root and shoot yield and NPK uptake of maize were increased compared with the control or recommended NPK, respectively. The present results indicate that short-term application of higher FYM levels improves soil properties. Furthermore, only the application of FYM at higher rates significantly increases the nutrient uptake of maize plants due to improved soil properties. Different amounts of nutrients supplied are responsible to increase biomass and nutrient uptake in plants.},

This paper develops a “local food energy model” for measuring sustainability potential of growing local food mainly vegetables in the home gardens. The outcomes indicate that potential of the home gardens in supplying vegetables demand as a share of total dietary energy would depend on the morphological characteristics of urban forms, total resident population, total food demand and other related factors.

Aims : We investigated the invasion process of Acacia mangium in savanna areas adjacent to large-scale forestry plantations in north-eastern Roraima State, Brazilian Amazonia. Methods : A tree inventory to record the presence of all A. mangium and native tree individuals was carried out in of 14 plots (each 50 m in width and 1500 m in length) established at five plantation sites. Biometric measurements were taken for all individuals to identify their structure and maturity. Distance categories were created for determining frequency of occurrence in 100 m sections along the plots for all individuals. Correlations and goodness-of-fit tests for discrete data ordered in categories were applied to verify the occurrence of A. mangium plants in relation to distance from the plantation. Results : Individuals of A. mangium were dispersed up to 900 m from the plantation edge 8–9 years after the plantation was established. Although most recorded individuals were in the juvenile stage, reproductive adults were found in two establishment patterns: non-nucleated and nucleated under native tree species. Crown cover of the savanna's most abundant native tree species facilitated the regeneration of A. mangium. Conclusions : Planting of A. mangium in Amazonian savannas provides a source of continuous dispersal, and invasion by the species is facilitated by environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Soil microbial communities and their activities are altered by land use change; however impacts and extent of these alterations are often unclear. We investigated the functional responses of soil microbes in agricultural soil under sugarcane and corresponding native soil under Eucalyptus forest to additions of contrasting plant litter derived from soybean, sugarcane and Eucalyptus in a microcosm system, using a suite of complimentary techniques including enzyme assays and community level physiological profiles (CLPP). Initially agricultural soil had 50\% less microbial biomass and lower enzyme activities than forest soil, but significantly higher nitrification rates. In response to litter addition, microbial biomass increased up to 11-fold in agricultural soil, but only 1.8-fold in forest soil, suggesting a prevalence of rapidly proliferating ‘r’ and slower growing ‘K’ strategists in the respective soils. Litter-driven change in microbial biomass and activities were short lived, largely returning to pre-litter addition levels by day 150. Decomposition rates of sugarcane and soybean litter as estimated via CO2 production were lower in agricultural than in forest soil, but decomposition of more recalcitrant Eucalyptus litter was similar in both soils, contradicting the notion that microbial communities specialise in decomposing litter of the dominant local plant species. Enzyme activities and community level physiological profiles (CLPP) were closely correlated to microbial biomass and overall CO2 production in the agricultural soil but not the forest soil, suggesting contrasting relationships between microbial population dynamics and activity in the two soils. Activities of enzymes that break down complex biopolymers, such as protease, cellulase and phenol oxidase were similar or higher in the agricultural soil, which suggests that the production of extracellular biopolymer-degrading enzymes was not a factor limiting litter decomposition. Enzyme and CLPP analyses produced contrasting profiles of microbial activity in the two soils; however the combination of both analyses offers additional insights into the changes in microbial function and community dynamics that occur after conversion of forest to agricultural land.},

	abstract = {The quantities of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere from sugarcane fields, and their contribution to the total emissions from Australian agriculture, have never been estimated with any degree of certainty. This review was conducted to collate the available information on greenhouse gas emissions from the Australian sugarcane crop. Estimates were made for the emissions of the 3 major greenhouse gases\&horbar;carbon dioxide (CO$_{\textrm{2}}$), methane (CH$_{\textrm{4}}$), and nitrous oxide (N$_{\textrm{2}}$O)\&horbar;from known or suspected sources. Sinks for the sequestration of the gases also have been identified. CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ was found to be emitted during burning of the crop and from trash-blanketed and bare sugarcane fields. Total emissions from these sources in the 1994 season were estimated at 7\&\#183;6 Mt CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-C/year. However, the sugarcane crop was identified as a major sink for C, with uptake by the crop in 1994 estimated at 13\&\#183; 4 Mt CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-C/year. N$_{\textrm{2}}$O emanating from sugarcane soils via denitrification following application of fertiliser accounted for 45-78\% of total gaseous N emissions. Estimates of N$_{\textrm{2}}$O emissions from all land under sugarcane in 1994 totalled 4\&\#183;4 kt N$_{\textrm{2}}$O-N/year from denitrification with a further 6\&\#183;3 kt N$_{\textrm{2}}$O-N emitted from areas that are still burnt. This review suggests changes in management procedures that should limit the opportunities for denitrification in the soil and thus reduce N$_{\textrm{2}}$O emissions. Methane evolution occurs during the smouldering phase, following burning of the crop, with production estimated at 6\&\#183;7 kt CH$_{\textrm{4}}$-C/year in 1994. CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ oxidation in soil was identified as an important process for removal of atmospheric CH$_{\textrm{4}}$, as were trash-blanketed soils. Although these figures are our best estimate of gaseous production from sugarcane fields, there still remains a degree of uncertainty due to sampling variability and because of the extrapolation to the entire sugarcane area. However, the coupling of new laser techniques with known micrometeorological methods will allow for a more precise sampling of greenhouse gas emissions over a larger area. Estimates would thus be more representative, resulting in a greater degree of confidence being placed in them by the sugar industry.},

	abstract = {METHANE (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential (GWP) 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be produced or consumed in soils depending on environmental conditions and other factors. Biochar application to soils has been shown to reduce CH4 emissions and to increase CH4 consumption. However, the effects of rice husk biochar (RB) have not been thoroughly investigated. Two 60-day laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of amending two soil types with RB, raw mill mud (MM) and composted mill mud (CM) on soil CH4 consumption and emissions. Soil cores incubated in 1 L glass jars and gas samples were analysed for CH4 using gas chromatography. Average CH4 consumption rates varied from –0.06 to –0.68 g CH4-C/ha/d in sandy loam soil and –0.59 to –1.00 g CH4–C/ha/d in clay soil. Application of RB resulted in CH4 uptake of –0.52 to –0.55 g CH4-C/ha/d in sandy loam and –0.76 to –0.91 g CH4-C/ha/d in clay soil. Addition of MM showed low CH4 emissions or consumption at 60\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) in both soils. However, at high water contents ({\textgreater}75\% WFPS) the application of MM produced high rates of CH4 emissions which were significantly suppressed when RB was added. Cumulative emissions of the MM treatment produced 108.9 g CH4-C/ha at 75\% WFPS and 11 459.3 g CH4-C/ha at 90\% WFPS in sandy loam soil over a period of 60 days. RB can increase CH4 uptake under low soil water content (SWC) and decrease CH4 emissions under anaerobic conditions. CM expressed more potential to reduce CH4 emissions than those of MM.},

	abstract = {Tropical soils are important sources and sinks of atmospheric methane (CH4) and major sources of oxides of nitrogen gases, nitrous oxide (N2O) and NOx (NO+NO2). These gases are present in the atmosphere in trace amounts and are important to atmospheric chemistry and earth’s radiative balance. Although nitric oxide (NO) does not directly contribute to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation, it contributes to climate forcing through its role in photochemistry of hydroxyl radicals and ozone (O3) and plays a key role in air quality issues. Agricultural soils are a primary source of anthropogenic trace gas emissions, and the tropics and subtropics contribute greatly, particularly since 51\% of world soils are in these climate zones. The soil microbial processes responsible for the production and consumption of CH4 and production of N-oxides are the same in all parts of the globe, regardless of climate. Because of the ubiquitous nature of the basic enzymatic processes in the soil, the biological processes responsible for the production of NO, N2O and CH4, nitrification/denitrification and methanogenesis/methanotropy are discussed in general terms. Soil water content and nutrient availability are key controls for production, consumption and emission of these gases. Intensive studies of CH4 exchange in rice production systems made during the past decade reveal new insight. At the same time, there have been relatively few measurements of CH4, N2O or NOx, fluxes in upland tropical crop production systems. There are even fewer studies in which simultaneous measurements of these gases are reported. Such measurements are necessary for determining total greenhouse gas emission budgets. While intensive agricultural systems are important global sources of N2O and CH4 recent studies are revealing that the impact of tropical land use change on trace gas emissions is not as great as first reports suggested. It is becoming apparent that although conversion of forests to grazing lands initially induces higher N-oxide emissions than observed from the primary forest, within a few years emissions of NO and N2O generally fall below those from the primary forest. On the other hand, CH4 oxidation is typically greatly reduced and grazing lands may even become net sources in situations where soil compaction from cattle traffic limits gas diffusion. Establishment of tree-based systems following slash-and-burn agriculture enhances N2O and NO emissions during and immediately following burning. These emissions soon decline to rates similar to those observed in secondary forest while CH4 consumption rates are slightly reduced. Conversion to intensive cropping systems, on the other hand, results in significant increases in N2O emissions, a loss of the CH4 sink, and a substantial increase in the global warming potential compared to the forest and tree-based systems. The increasing intensification of crop production in the tropics, in which N fertilization must increase for many crops to sustain production, will most certainly increase N-oxide emissions. The increase, however, may be on the same order as that expected in temperate crop production, thus smaller than some have predicted. In addition, increased attention to management of fertilizer and water may reduce trace gas emissions and simultaneously increase fertilizer use efficiency.},

	url = {http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167265},
	abstract = {Contemporary cropping systems have to combine high yields with environmental sustainability. The conversion of nitrogen (N) fertiliser to forms which are easily lost from soil (as nitrate or gaseous N compounds) is driven by soil biology, specifically the soil microbial community. Although knowledge of soil microbial activity is crucial for minimising N loss, it is not known how soil conditions and associated microbes can best be manipulated through farming practices. We have developed new tools for fingerprinting microbial activities in soil. Our new method quantifies, for the first time, the activities of microbial genes that are switched on or off under certain conditions in the soil. The method links soil parameters and microbial activities by using a new custom-made microarray. The advantage of this novel mRNA-based approach is that it (i) measures of the ‘microbial activity’ rather than the ‘presence’ of specific microbes, (ii) monitors ‘activities’ of many microbial groups simultaneously, (iii) provides insights into whole-system soil biology. We have applied this technique to monitor microbial activities in cane soils with different management histories. Our preliminary results indicate that the method can successfully detect differences in the microbial activities of soils with different fertiliser application and N2O emission rates (Mackay), and different cropping history (Ingham). Ultimately this research will provide information for farmers to effectively manipulate soil biology to reduce N loss and improve productivity.},

	abstract = {While no yield benefits have been demonstrated to split applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer, uncertainty existed within the sugar industry as to the opportunity to improve fertilizer N uptake efficiency by splitting applications. A rates-of-N fertilizer trial, with split applications was conducted over third- and fourth-ratoon crops in the Rocky Point area (Queensland, Australia) where the site was waterlogged for 24 h by irrigation in the third ratoon and by local flooding and heavy rain in the fourth ratoon. Fertilizer treatments were 0, 100 and 200 kgN/ha, with single and split applications of the applied fertilizer rates. Major waterlogging events occurred between application of basal fertilizer and the split application. The zero-N treatment on the humic gley soil accumulated approximately 80 kgN/ha from soil mineral N, and N acquisition in the fertilized treatments was ranked in accordance with applied N. There was no benefit to final N uptake or yield from the split applications of N fertilizer. Fertilizer N use efficiency peaked at 35-40\% for the third-ratoon crop and 15-20\% in the wetter fourth-ratoon crop. The difference was attributed to early loss of fertilizer N in the latter crop. The generally small and non-significant response to the 200 kgN/ha rate over the 100 kgN/ha rate supports the current recommendation of 110 kgN/ha for this soil type.},

Sugarcane bagasse, which is a complex material, is the major by-product of the sugar cane industry. It contains about 50\% cellulose, 25\% hemicellulose and 25\% lignin. Due to its abundant availability, it can serve as an ideal substrate for microbial processes for the production of value-added products. Attempts have been made to produce from bagasse substrate protein-enriched animal feed, enzymes, amino acids, organic acids and compounds of pharmaceutical importance, etc. Often, a pre-treatment process has resulted in improved substrate utilization by the microbes. Application of solid-state fermentation technology could be an attractive possibility for such bioconversions.

This study presents a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on gasoline and ethanol as fuels, and with two types of blends of gasoline with bioethanol, all used in a midsize car. The focus is on a main application in Brazil, sugarcane based ethanol. The results of two cases are presented: base case—bioethanol production from sugarcane and electricity generation from bagasse; future case—bioethanol production from both sugarcane and bagasse and electricity generation from wastes. In both cases sugar is co-produced. The life cycles of fuels include gasoline production, agricultural production of sugarcane, ethanol production, sugar and electricity co-production, blending ethanol with gasoline to produce E10 (10\% of ethanol) and E85 (85\%), and finally the use of gasoline, E10, E85 and pure ethanol. Furthermore, a life cycle costing (LCC) was conducted to give an indication on fuel economy in both cases. The results show that in the base case less GHG is emitted; while the overall evaluation of these fuel options depends on the importance attached to different impacts. The future case is certainly more economically attractive, which has been the driving force for development in the ethanol industry in Brazil. Nevertheless, the outcomes depend very much on the assumed price for crude oil. In LCC a steady-state cost model was used and only the production cost was taken into account. In the real market the prices of fuels are very much dependent on the taxes and subsidies. Technological development can help in lowering both the environmental impact and the prices of the ethanol fuels.},

This technique is very useful in the estimation of energy usage and environmental load by a product/system. The demand of sugar is very high in the world market. So sugar industry is the leading industry, which produces sugar with the help of sugarcane mostly. In sugar industry, different sizes of sugar crystals and also some by-products such as bagasse, molasses, filter cake and ash are produced. Out of these, some are used an input resource in other plants like power plant and distillery for optimal utilization of waste produced in sugar industry. The outputs of power plant (electricity and steam) used in mills, distilleries, residences of sugar industry and supply to grid for sell. The molasses is the waste of sugar which is used for the production of ethanol, so molasses is a by-product of sugar industry. LCA and waste management methods are very helpful to analyse and reduce the environmental effects.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilization of agricultural systems is thought to be a major source of the increase in atmospheric N2O; NO emissions from soils have also been shown to increase due to N fertilization. While N fertilizer use is increasing rapidly in the developing world and in the tropics, nearly all of our information on gas emissions is derived from studies of temperate zone agriculture. Using chambers, we measured fluxes of N2O and NO following urea fertilization in tropical sugar cane systems growing on several soil types in the Hawaiian Islands, United States. On the island of Maui, where urea is applied in irrigation lines and soils are mollisols and inceptisols, N2O fluxes were elevated for a week or less after fertilization; maximum average fluxes were typically less than 30 ng cm−2 h−1. NO fluxes were often an order of magnitude less than N2O. Together, N2O and NO represented from 0.03 to 0.5\% of the applied N. In fields on the island of Hawaii, where urea is broadcast on the surface and soils are andisols, N2O fluxes were similar in magnitude to Maui but remained elevated for much longer periods after fertilization. NO emissions were 2–5 times higher than N2O through most of the sampling periods. Together the gas losses represented approximately 1.1–2.5\% of the applied N. Laboratory studies indicate that denitrification is a critical source of N2O in Maui, but that nitrification is more important in Hawaii. Experimental studies suggest that differences in the pattern of N2O/NO and the processes producing them are a result of both carbon availability and placement of fertilizer and that the more information-intensive fertilizer management practice results in lower emissions.},

We discuss the farm's environmental and institutional sustainability, situating its development within the larger context of contemporary Chinese agriculture, and we examine the potential for future success with CSA models in China based on evidence from this case.},

The change in agricultural land use can alter belowground carbon (C) stocks associated with changes in the types of plant species. The aim of this study was to investigate how the cessation of cultivation influenced the soil C storage in former agricultural fields. The study sites were previously used for rice (Poaceae, Oriza sativa L.) and wheat (Poaceae, Triticum L.) cultivation, and fallow management practices had been in effect for three years under three different conditions: two treatments involved mowing and either leaving the plant residue on the ground or removing the plant residue, while the third treatment involved simply abandoning the field. We found that the former paddy site invaded by rhizomatous perennial grasses had significantly higher soil C storage compared to former upland fields that was dominated by annual grass species. The cessation of cultivation increased soil C storage by about 1.3 times in former paddies, and decreased the content by 0.83–0.91 times in former uplands. The three-year total belowground production was 2.0–4.7 times greater in former paddies than former uplands for each management condition, suggesting that lower C input from the annual grasses caused a loss in soil C at the upland fields. Aboveground biomass removal of the perennial grasses strongly reduced C input, whereas the C input from their high belowground production led to the significant increases of soil C storage near the surface of the former paddies. Our studies indicate that high belowground productivity of perennial grasses can increase soil C storage after the cessation of cultivation.},

Additional, complementary strategies for the greening of food supply chains are examined. To analyse the interaction between local and global dynamics, the sociology of networks and flows is applied to the case of marine fish production and consumption in order to identify innovative governance arrangements that make global supply chains more sustainable. Certifying fisheries and the use of fish wallet cards by consumers are examples of new governance arrangements that connect sustainability concerns of consumers with production decisions made by distant actors. To improve the effectiveness of these arrangements, new roles are proposed for environmental NGOs as representatives of local actors and as managers of trust in certifying institutions.},

Reducing health risks by developing alternatives to synthetic pesticides may be beneficial for consumers and producers. This study assesses the potential market for organically grown vegetables and analyzes consumer awareness and perceptions of synthetic pesticide residues in vegetables. Price levels that consumers are willing to pay for chemical-free vegetable products were evaluated. A hedonic-pricing model (preferences choice) was used to identify determinants of consumer willingness to pay for organically grown vegetables. Data were collected with a questionnaire on consumer perceptions of produce quality problems, awareness of pesticide use on vegetables, and willingness to pay for synthetic pesticide free vegetables. Consumers were aware of heavy use of synthetic pesticides on vegetables. Consumer preferences for quality vegetables included damage free, freshness, size, color, and firmness. Consumers were willing to pay a premium of more than 50\% for synthetic pesticide-free vegetables. The most likely factors affecting consumer willingness to pay for organically grown vegetables were awareness of chemical residues and health risks, damage free, reliable availability of products, taste, and income level. There is a potential demand for synthetic pesticide-free vegetables.},

Soil loss (along with soil fertility), increasing water demand from agricultural practices and environmental pollution caused by the intensive use of agrochemicals, are among the most pressing issues concerning agriculture sustainability. Biodiversity loss due to land use change and emission of greenhouse gasses from agricultural activities are also causes for concern. A number of alternative agricultural practices are also presented that can help to make agriculture less environmentally damaging by reducing the use of natural resources, limiting inputs and preserving soil fertility and biodiversity. We think that there is room for a different and more ecological agriculture and that research should be implemented in order to better assess the potential and constraints of the different options. However, notwithstanding the great achievements of the “Green Revolution,” the world will need 70 to 100\% more food by 2050. So a new challenge lies ahead: how to feed nine billion with less land, water and energy, while at the same time preserving natural resources and soil fertility? Technical advances are important in order to meet the future needs, but addressing key socioeconomic issues, such as the inequality in the access to resources, population growth, and access to education are also a priority if we want to properly deal with sustainability. It may require our society to change some of its paradigms and “values” if we wish to preserve our support system, the soil and its health, for the future generations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climates are changing worldwide at rates not seen previously in geological time. This affects food production itself and the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which reduce crop yield and quality. There is a need to develop an understanding of the implications and impacts of climate change on natural biodiversity, artificial landscapes as well as production agriculture (defined here as a generalization embracing all of the primary uses of land for agriculture, horticulture and forestry), since these form parts of an integrated continuum. Currently, 20–25\% of harvested crops worldwide are lost to pre- and post-harvest diseases and climatic change is expected to increase these losses. Climatic change results in increasing variability and altered scales of temperature, rainfall and wind velocity and periodicity. These changes affect the activities and vigour of aerial and soilborne pathogens. Some pathogens capable of devastating crops and harvested produce have become more active and damaging because their geographical ranges expand as a consequence of climate change. Human populations are increasing rapidly, resulting in greater demands on all natural resources which far outstrip supplies. Natural biodiversity is being damaged, frequently beyond repair and not infrequently with little or no knowledge of the characteristics of the plant genotypes being lost. Only very recently have analyses of ecosystem services begun revealing the intricate and delicate webs of unappreciated natural assets which are vital for human sustainable (used here to describe processes and actions which balance resource-use with resource-availability and conserve economic, environmental and social welfare) survival. The combination of climatic change, expanding human demands for food, resources and space and the increased activities of plant pathogens presents pathologists with immense challenges. Previously, visionary plant pathologists have contributed hugely to solving humanity's problems. Current challenges compounded by climate change offer opportunities for the exploitation of our profession's capacities for working with ‘one foot in the furrow (and) one hand on the bench’ with increasing relevance for society at large.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT In the 21st century, nutrient efficient plants will play a major role in increasing crop yields compared to the 20th century, mainly due to limited land and water resources available for crop production, higher cost of inorganic fertilizer inputs, declining trends in crop yields globally, and increasing environmental concerns. Furthermore, at least 60\% of the world's arable lands have mineral deficiencies or elemental toxicity problems, and on such soils fertilizers and lime amendments are essential for achieving improved crop yields. Fertilizer inputs are increasing cost of production of farmers, and there is a major concern for environmental pollution due to excess fertilizer inputs. Higher demands for food and fiber by increasing world populations further enhance the importance of nutrient efficient cultivars that are also higher producers. Nutrient efficient plants are defined as those plants, which produce higher yields per unit of nutrient, applied or absorbed than other plants (standards) under similar agroecological conditions. During the last three decades, much research has been conducted to identify and/or breed nutrient efficient plant species or genotypes/cultivars within species and to further understand the mechanisms of nutrient efficiency in crop plants. However, success in releasing nutrient efficient cultivars has been limited. The main reasons for limited success are that the genetics of plant responses to nutrients and plant interactions with environmental variables are not well understood. Complexity of genes involved in nutrient use efficiency for macro and micronutrients and limited collaborative efforts between breeders, soil scientists, physiologists, and agronomists to evaluate nutrient efficiency issues on a holistic basis have hampered progress in this area. Hence, during the 21st century agricultural scientists have tremendous challenges, as well as opportunities, to develop nutrient efficient crop plants and to develop best management practices that increase the plant efficiency for utilization of applied fertilizers. During the 20th century, breeding for nutritional traits has been proposed as a strategy to improve the efficiency of fertilizer use or to obtain higher yields in low input agricultural systems. This strategy should continue to receive top priority during the 21st century for developing nutrient efficient crop genotypes. This paper over views the importance of nutrient efficient plants in increasing crop yields in modern agriculture. Further, definitions and available methods of calculating nutrient use efficiency, mechanisms for nutrient uptake and use efficiency, role of crops in nutrient use efficiency under biotic and abiotic stresses and breeding strategies to improve nutrient use efficiency in crop plants have been discussed.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) has long been recognized as an important indicator of soil productivity. The SOM refers to the organic fraction of the soil exclusive of undecayed plant and animal residues. It plays a crucial role in maintaining sustainability of cropping systems by improving soil physical (texture, structure, bulk density, and water-holding capacity), chemical (nutrient availability, cation exchange capacity, reduced aluminum toxicity, and allelopathy), and biological (nitrogen mineralization bacteria, dinitrogen fixation, mycorrhizae fungi, and microbial biomass) properties. The preservation of SOM is crucial to ensure long-term sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Improvement/preservation of soil organic matter can be achieved by adopting appropriate soil and crop management practices. These practices include conservation tillage, crop rotation, use of organic manures, increasing cropping intensity, use of adequate rate of chemical fertilizers, incorporation of crop residues, liming acidic soils, and keeping land under pasture. Organic matter can adsorb heavy metals in the soils, which reduce toxicity of these metals to plants and reduce their escape to ground water. Similarly, SOM also adsorbs herbicides, which may inhibit contamination of surface and ground water. Furthermore, SOM also functions as a sink to organic carbon and mitigates carbon dioxide (CO2) gas escape to the environment. Globally, soil organic matter contains about three times as much carbon as found in the world's vegetation. Hence, organic matter plays a critical role in the global carbon balance that is thought to be the major factor affecting global warming. Overall, adequate amounts of soil organic matter maintain soil quality, preserve sustainability of cropping systems, and reduce environmental pollution.},

	abstract = {Horticulture in the Netherlands is an economically strong sector. However, current organic horticulture does not comply with the standards for sustainability, because of its contribution to environmental pollution and exhaustion of natural resources. Transition towards more sustainable agro-ecosystems is inevitable for horticulture in the Netherlands to maintain its international competitive position. In this paper, we describe a study commissioned by the Dutch government aimed at testing an approach for participatory technology design and at generating commitment of stakeholders. In brainstorming sessions with representatives from research, extension and the horticultural sector, three draft scenarios were defined, based on political, societal and scientific goals for sustainable production systems. However, these draft scenarios were mainly formulated in a ‘top-down’ approach and within the sector no shared problem perception existed. So, strong identification with the sector was necessary to formulate more appealing scenarios. In interviews, various stakeholders, selected from the primary sector, the retail sector and other interested organizations were asked for their opinions about the scenarios, possible perspectives of the approach and their interest in participating in further development. In response to their interests in a participatory process, reformulation of the scenarios involved profound adaptation of both, objectives and pathways, and resulted in two modified scenarios, an economically driven organic production system and a socially driven organic city greenhouse. It is concluded that the approach of participatory technology design, the model of iterative learning and practice change, worked well. We learned that entrepreneurs are not inspired by long-term perspectives without clear short-term gains. Hence, the long-term aims of the government were translated into a series of steps, each in the short term resulting in partial realization of the goals. So, we experienced that we can affect the adoption behaviour of the entrepreneur by matching long-term aims with short-term interests.},

Plant defenses put selection pressure on plant-consumers and, as a result, herbivores and pathogens have evolved counter-adaptations to avoid, resist, or manipulate plant defenses.

To be sure, the Germanic tribes that had settled in the few existing open spaces had, over the course of the millennia, advanced from the stage of hunting and gathering to that of agriculture and raising domestic animals.1 They never numbered more than one million, however, and so the forests remained the predominant feature in these areas. Thus, at the time of Tacitus it would not have occurred to anyone in the realm of ‘Germania’ that it was necessary to take care of these forests in order to save them from the fate that had overtaken the forests surrounding the Mediterranean, which for the most part had already been sacrificed to the axe. And so, while damage due to erosion and karstification was already evident to the south, the landscape in the north was still dominated by the forests.},

Today along the front range of the Taurus Mountains this forest is completely denuded or otherwise replanted with recent growth in the past 80 years. We employ paleoenvironmental analysis of relic cedar forests in the Taurus Mountains to construct a timeline of anthropogenic disturbances associated with population growth over time and thereby assess the sustainability of ancient forestry practices. To obtain these data, the team recovers pollen and carbon samples from geomorphologic trenches excavated in the cedar zone, tree ring data from dendrochronological survey of the existing forest, and archaeological data from remains of ancient highland settlements. Preliminary results indicate that current perspectives about the timing of deforestation in this region are flawed and that the initial deforestation coincided with regional site abandonment and population decline at the end of antiquity.},

We considered variations in understorey species composition and richness. The sampled understorey species were characterized in terms of functional traits, Ellenberg's indicator values and taxonomic distinctness; next, we calculated four different pairwise plot-to-plot dissimilarity matrices based on species composition, functional traits, Ellenberg's indices and taxonomic distances. We applied a permutational multivariate extension of ANOVA to test whether the forest stands significantly differ in the considered features. Indicator values of all plant species in managed and old-growth stands were evaluated. The old-growth forest had a higher species richness; permutational analysis of variance showed significant differences between the two stands in plant species composition, functional traits, Ellenberg indices and taxonomic distances. Indicator species analysis highlighted 14 indicator species for the unmanaged stand, while only 3 indicators were found for the managed one. The results suggest that forest management determines ecological differences that strongly affect plant species composition. The knowledge of natural stands dynamics could allow development of new approaches and practices in forest management focusing on biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Managing urban ancient woodland sustainably is problematic and furthermore, there is a lack of detailed, long-term case-study evidence. These issues are discussed with respect to a particular case study site in Sheffield, England. This example is especially informative due to the long timeline of the known site management. It also raises serious issues for future management and the consequences of the processes of urbanisation. Composition, structure and condition of the case-study wood, Bowden Housteads Wood, prior to management in early 1988, are placed in their historical and social contexts. When late twentieth-century management took place, it was the first active intervention on the site for over a century. The implementation of a series of management plans are then described covering the periods 1987–1991, 2000–2005 and 2009–2013. Interpretation of vegetation condition and the monitoring of recovery following intervention demonstrated a remarkable ability of typical ancient woodland flora to reappear. However, there are long-term issues of human encroachment onto the site from nearby housing with the twin impacts of (1) introduction of exotic and potentially invasive species, and (2) destruction of the last pockets of rare woodland indicator plants. The paper emphasises that, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, managing public amenity woods in heavily populated urban areas is as much about public relations as it is about woodmanship and ecological principles. Furthermore, managing publicly owned amenity woodland is a long-term process and this becomes problematic when public services are being rapidly eroded by national governmental policies. The paper reflects action research and observation with stakeholders over a 30-year period.},

	abstract = {Given the widespread attention paid to global climate change over the last decade or so, a potential need has arisen to develop forest management plans for broad areas that address vulnerabilities and complexities in the environment with respect to potential changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns. These planning issues include recognizing potential range shifts in forest vegetation, changes in land uses, and changes in the growth and yield of forest tree species, particularly along the leading or trailing edges of the shifting ranges. In addition to assessing traditional forestry concerns (production, sustainability, fragmentation, and ecosystem health), planning processes will likely one day incorporate natural disturbance regimes and the impacts of invasive species. As these are often unpredictable events, planning processes will therefore probably have numerous stochastic processes that suggest the use of simulation models rather than the more popular deterministic mathematical programming models that are often used in forest planning today (e.g. linear programming). This review examines the changes that have occurred in forest planning since 2009, when a set of challenges facing forest planning, with respect to potential changes in the climate, were posed. We noted through a review of the literature that some areas of concern have received considerable attention of late (shifts in vegetation patterns, assessments of carbon sequestration, disaggregation of global climate model results), while other areas (e.g. natural disturbance modeling) have received less attention. These results relate directly to the use of concepts in forest planning rather than theoretical advancements along different lines of inquiry; therefore there may be some lag time involved in transitioning from theory to practice.},

There was little difference in yield between the 2 treatments, but soil organic C increased steadily in the GCTB treatment. These results, and their time trends were successfully reproduced by the model both during the experimental period and in the long-term simulations. The impact of GCTB on the soil water and N balance were examined in the long-term simulations. While deep drainage was higher, and runoff and soil evaporation lower under GCTB, average N losses (through denitrification and leaching) were similar to those in the burnt treatment because much of the soil nitrate was immobilized by the decomposing trash blanket.

	abstract = {The efficiency of N utilization in photosynthesis and dry Inatter production (NUE) is an important crop performance criterion. Our objectives were to characterize the magnitude and physiological correlates of variation in NUE in the C-4 grass, sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid). Two genotypes known to differ with regard to their resistance to drought and salinity stress were grown in solution culture in a glasshouse at three levels of N availability (0.1, 1.0, and 10 mM N). Photosynthetic gas exchange, dry matter accumulation, carboxylase activity, chlorophyll content, leaf N status, and plant-water relations characteristics were evaluated. Leaf water potential and plant hydraulic conductance decreased as applied N was reduced from 10 to 0.1 mM. At a given leaf N status, NUE was always significantly higher in the stress-resistant genotype (H69-8235) than in the susceptible genotype (H65-7052). However, a large genetic difference in dry weight accumulation at a given level of external N supply was observed only at 10 mM applied N. Higher NUE in H69-8235 was strongly associated with greater relative partitioning of leaf N to chlorophyll and ribulose 1,5-bisposphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). The fraction of leaf N partitioned to the photosynthetic apparatus increased with declining N content in both genotypes. Photosynthetic and dry matter-based NUE were not entirely consistent with each other because growth was more sensitive than photosynthesis to N stress. It may be possible to further improve the already high NUE of C-4 grasses by screening genotypes for differences in partitioning of leaf N into components of the photosynthetic apparatus such as chlorophyll and Rubisco.},

	abstract = {Vegetarians exhibit a wide diversity of dietary practices, often described by what is omitted from their diet. When a vegetarian diet is appropriately planned and includes fortified foods, it can be nutritionally adequate for adults and children and can promote health and lower the risk of major chronic diseases. The nutrients of concern in the diet of vegetarians include vitamin B12, vitamin D, ω-3 fatty acids, calcium, iron, and zinc. Although a vegetarian diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients, the use of supplements and fortified foods provides a useful shield against deficiency. A vegetarian diet usually provides a low intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and a high intake of dietary fiber and many health-promoting phytochemicals. This is achieved by an increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, legumes, nuts, and various soy products. As a result of these factors, vegetarians typically have lower body mass index, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and blood pressure; reduced rates of death from ischemic heart disease; and decreased incidence of hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers than do nonvegetarians.},

	abstract = {Vegetarians are at risk for vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency due to suboptimal intake. The goal of the present literature review was to assess the rate of B12 depletion and deficiency among vegetarians and vegans. Using a PubMed search to identify relevant publications, 18 articles were found that reported B12 deficiency rates from studies that identified deficiency by measuring methylmalonic acid, holo-transcobalamin II, or both. The deficiency rates reported for specific populations were as follows: 62\% among pregnant women, between 25\% and almost 86\% among children, 21–41\% among adolescents, and 11–90\% among the elderly. Higher rates of deficiency were reported among vegans compared with vegetarians and among individuals who had adhered to a vegetarian diet since birth compared with those who had adopted such a diet later in life. The main finding of this review is that vegetarians develop B12 depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegetarians should thus take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B12.},

	abstract = {Plant-derived fibres and resins can provide biomaterials with environmental, health and financial benefits. Australian arid zone grasses have not been explored as sources of modern biomaterials including building materials. Triodia grasslands are a dominant vegetation type in the arid and semiarid regions of Australia covering a third of the continent. Of the 69 identified Triodia species, 26 produce resin from specialised cells in the outer leaf epidermis. In Aboriginal culture, Triodia biomass and resin were valued for their usefulness in cladding shelters and as a hafting agent. Since European settlement, Triodia grasslands have been used for cattle grazing and burning is a common occurrence to improve pasture value and prevent large-scale fires. Although Triodia grasslands are relatively stable to fires, more frequent and large-scale fires impact on other fire sensitive woody and herbaceous species associated with Triodia and invasion of exotic weeds resulting in localised changes in vegetation structure and composition. The extent and change occurring in Triodia grasslands as a result of altered land-use practices, fire regimes, and changing climate warrant careful consideration of their future management. Localised harvesting of Triodia grasslands could have environmental benefits and provide much needed biomaterials for desert living. Research is underway to evaluate the material properties of Triodia biomass and resin in the context of Indigenous and western scientific knowledge. Here, we review uses of Triodia and highlight research needs if sustainable harvesting is to be considered.},

The conventional chemicals sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and an alternative chemical, sodium borohydrate (NaBH4), were utilized in the chemical treatment procedure. Results showed that the samples treated with NaOH (83.9\%) and NaBH4 (82.9\%) gave higher glucan conversion in enzymatic hydrolysis compared to those treated with H2O2 (74.5\%) and H2SO4 (56.6\%). The highest ethanol yield from untreated stalks (97.4g/kg) was obtained when the stalks were pretreated with 4\% NaBH4 for 90min; the theoretical ethanol yield was found to be 72.5\%.},

	abstract = {The present study's objectives were to quantify the fertilizer-N and residue-N balances of a sugar cane crop under two trash management systems. The fate of nitrogen (N) derived from fertilizer (NdfF) and N derived from residue (NdfR) was studied comparing: (i) the traditional harvest system with trash burning before harvest (“trash burning”) and (ii) an alternative system without trash burning, in which crop residues are left on the soil surface (“trash mulching”). The experiment consisted of three treatments: (i) T1: at planting, the sugarcane crop was fertilized with 63 kg N ha−1 as 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate, and after the 1st harvest received unlabeled trash from T2; (ii) T2: at planting, the crop was fertilized with 63 kg N ha−1 as unlabeled ammonium sulfate. At the 1st harvest time, this treatment received the labeled trash from T1; (iii) T3: at planting, the crop was fertilized with 63 kg N ha−1 as 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate, and every year, immediately before cutting, the crop residues were burnt. After the first harvest fertilizer-N was applied over the total soil area at a rate of 80 kg N ha−1 as unlabeled ammonium sulfate. The results indicated that the trash remaining as a surface blanket resulted in an average N recycling of 105.0 kg ha−1 year−1, while the practice of burning the trash produced an average N loss from the system of 83.5 kg ha−1 year−1. At the first harvest, about 75\% of the labeled N was recovered in the soil–plant system. The majority was found in the plant, indicating a high availability of the fertilizer-N for the crop. At the end of the third crop cycle (2nd ratoon crop harvest), the total output of fertilizer-N (export+burning) was 60\% for the burnt-trash treatment, and only 42\% (export) for the trash-blanket treatment. The N liberated from the residue is mainly immobilized in the soil, reflecting that sugarcane trash is an N source of slow availability to the crop. This study indicated that green cane harvesting followed by mulching leads to a more efficient recycling of the N applied to the system and therefore reducing fertilizer-N needs.},

	abstract = {It is not surprising that humans have profoundly altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle in an effort to feed 7 billion people, because nitrogen is an essential plant and animal nutrient. Food and energy production from agriculture, combined with industrial and energy sources, have more than doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen circulating annually on land. Humanity has disrupted the nitrogen cycle even more than the carbon (C) cycle. We present new research results showing widespread effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, human health, and climate, suggesting that in spite of decades of research quantifying the negative consequences of too much available nitrogen in the biosphere, solutions remain elusive. There have been important successes in reducing nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere and this has improved air quality. Effective solutions for reducing nitrogen losses from agriculture have also been identified, although political and economic impediments to their adoption remain. Here, we focus on the major sources of reactive nitrogen for the United States (U.S.), their impacts, and potential mitigation options. Sources: ??? Intensive development of agriculture, industry, and transportation has profoundly altered the U.S. nitrogen cycle. ??? Nitrogen emissions from the energy and transportation sectors are declining, but agricultural emissions are increasing. ??? Approximately half of all nitrogen applied to boost agricultural production escapes its intended use and is lost to the environment. Impacts: ??? Two-thirds of U.S. coastal systems are moderately to severely impaired due to nutrient loading; there are now approximately 300 hypoxic (low oxygen) zones along the U.S. coastline and the number is growing. One third of U.S. streams and two fifths of U.S. lakes are impaired by high nitrogen concentrations. ??? Air pollution continues to reduce biodiversity. A nation-wide assessment has documented losses of nitrogen-sensitive native species in favor of exotic, invasive species. ??? More than 1.5 million Americans drink well water contaminated with too much (or close to too much) nitrate (a regulated drinking water pollutant), potentially placing them at increased risk of birth defects and cancer. More research is needed to deepen understanding of these health risks. ??? Several pathogenic infections, including coral diseases, bird die-offs, fish diseases, and human diarrheal diseases and vector-borne infections are associated with nutrient losses from agriculture and from sewage entering ecosystems. ??? Nitrogen is intimately linked with the carbon cycle and has both warming and cooling effects on the climate. Mitigation Options: ??? Regulation of nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from energy and transportation sectors has greatly improved air quality, especially in the eastern U.S. Nitrogen oxide is expected to decline further as stronger regulations take effect, but ammonia remains mostly unregulated and is expected to increase unless better controls on ammonia emissions from livestock operations are implemented. ??? Nitrogen loss from farm and livestock operations can be reduced 30-50\% using current practices and technologies and up to 70-90\% with innovative applications of existing methods. Current U.S. agricultural policies and support systems, as well as declining investments in agricultural extension, impede the adoption of these practices. Society faces profound challenges to meet demands for food, fiber, and fuel while minimizing unintended environmental and human health impacts. While our ability to quantify transfers of nitrogen across land, water, and air has improved since the first publication of this series in 1997, an even bigger challenge remains: using the science for effective management policies that reduce climate change, improve water quality, and protect human and environmental health. ??

	abstract = {There is a growing need for all productive sectors to develop greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation techniques to reduce the enhanced greenhouse effect. However, the challenge to the agricultural sector is reducing net emissions while increasing production to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and biofuel. This study focuses on the changes in the GHG balance when sugarcane areas are converted from burned harvest (BH) to green harvest (GH, mechanized harvest), including the changes caused by the adoption of conservationist practices such as reduced tillage and a 4-month crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. during sugarcane replanting. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2006) methodologies, the annual emission balance includes both agricultural and mobile sources of GHG, according to the mean annual consumption of supplies per hectare. The potential soil carbon accumulation was also considered in the GH plot. The total amounts of GHG were 2651.9 and 2316.4 kg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1 for BH and GH, respectively. Factoring in a mean annual soil carbon accumulation rate of 888.1 kg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 due to the input from long-term crop residues associated with the conversion from BH to GH, the emission balance in GH decreased to 1428.3 kg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1. A second decrease occurs when a reduced tillage strategy is adopted instead of conventional tillage during the replanting season in the GH plot, which helps reduce the total emission balance to 1180.3 kg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1. Moreover, the conversion of sugarcane from BH to GH, with the adoption of a crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. as well as reduced tillage during sugarcane replanting, would result in a smaller GHG balance of 1064.6 kg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1, providing an effect strategy for GHG mitigation while still providing cleaner sugar and ethanol production in southern Brazil.},

	abstract = {Leaching is disadvantageous, both for economical and environmental reasons since it may decrease the ecosystem productivity and may also contribute to the contamination of surface and ground water. The objective of this paper was to quantify the loss of nitrogen and sulfur by leaching, at the depth of 0.9 m, in an Ultisol in São Paulo State (Brazil) with high permeability, cultivated with sugarcane during the agricultural cycle of crop plant. The following ions were evaluated: nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate were also evaluated at the same depth. The sugarcane was planted and fertilized in the furrows with 120 kg ha−1 of N-urea. In order to find out the fate of N-fertilizer, four microplots with 15N-enriched fertilizer were installed. Input and output of the considered ions at the depth of 0.9 m were quantified from the flux density of water and the concentration of the elements in the soil solution at this soil depth: tensiometers, soil water retention curve and soil solution extractors were used for this quantification. The internal drainage was 205 mm of water, with a total loss of 18 kg ha−1 of N and 10 kg ha−1 of S. The percentage of N in the soil solution derived from the fertilizer (\%NSSDF) was 1.34, resulting in only 25 g ha−1 of N fertilizer loss by leaching during all agricultural cycle. Under the experimental conditions of this crop plant, that is, high demand of nutrients and high incorporation of crop residues, the leached N represented 15\% of applied N and S leaching were not considerable; the higher amount of leached N was native nitrogen and a minor quantity from N fertilizer; and the leached amount of Ca, Mg, K and P did not exceed the applications performed in the crop by lime and fertilization.},

	abstract = {Recent estimates put average coral cover across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at about 20–30\%. This is estimated to be a large reduction since the 1960s. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was enacted in 1975 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) set up shortly afterwards. So the question is: why has coral cover continued to decline when the GBR is being managed with a management regime often recognised as ‘the best managed coral reef system in the world’, based on a strong science-for-management ethic. The stressors which are known to be most responsible for the loss of coral cover (and general ‘reef health’) are terrestrial pollution including the link to outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish, fishing impacts and climate change. These have been established through a long and intensive research effort over the last 30 years. However the management response of the GBRMPA after 1975, while based on a strong science-for-management program, did not concentrate on these issues but instead on managing access through zoning with restrictions on fishing in very limited areas and tourism management. Significant action on fishing, including trawling, did not occur until the Trawl Management Plan of 2000 and the rezoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004. Effective action on terrestrial pollution did not occur until the Australian Government Reef Rescue initiative which commenced in 2008. Effective action on climate change has yet to begin either nationally or globally. Thus it is not surprising that coral cover on the GBR has reduced to values similar to those seen in other coral reef areas in the world such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Science has always required long periods to acquire sufficient evidence to drive management action and hence there is a considerable time lag between the establishment of scientific evidence and the introduction of effective management. It can still be credibly claimed that the GBR is the best managed coral reef system in the world but it must be realised that this is a relative assessment against other reef systems and management regimes and not an absolute claim for effective management.},

	abstract = {Stillage, a product of ethanol production from the fermentation of molasses, is used as a
source of potassium on cane fields at Ubombo Sugar Ltd, Big Bend, Swaziland. The stillage
is fortified with urea to provide nitrogen (N) and/or phosphoric acid to supply phosphorus (P)
where necessary. Following perceptions by Section/Farm Managers that there were higher
nitrogen losses where stillage had been applied late in the season compared to where fertilizer
granules were used, a field experiment was carried out on a first ratoon field on a T-Set soil.
The objective of the experiment was to assess the effect of splitting nitrogen in stillage
compared with standard granular fertilizer blends on sugarcane yield and quality parameters.
The treatments were (1) urea enriched stillage blend (180 kg N/ha + 180 kg K/ha), (2)
granular fertilizer blend (180 kg N/ha + 180 kg K/ha), (3) urea enriched stillage blend (90 kg
N/ha + 180 kg K/ha) + 90 kg N/ha applied eight weeks later, and (4) granular fertilizer blend
(90 kg N/ha + 180 kg K/ha) + 90 kg N/ha applied eight weeks later. The rates were derived
from soil analysis results. The treatments were replicated five times in a randomised complete
block design (RCBD). The results indicated no statistically significant differences in cane and
sucrose yields in all the treatments. It was therefore concluded that splitting the N in both
stillage and granular fertilizer was not necessary at this time of the year.},

The effects of different characteristics of the original raw material on the biochemical composition of vinasse and their C and N mineralization in soil were investigated. Vinasse samples were obtained from similar industrial fermentation processes based on the growth of microorganisms on molasses from different raw material (sugar beet or sugar cane) and vinasse concentration (dilute or concentrated). The nature of the raw material used for fermentation had the greatest effect on the nature and size of the resistant organic pool. This fraction included aromatic compounds originating from the raw material or from complex molecules and seemed to be quantitatively related to acid-insoluble N. Samples derived from sugar beet were richer in N compounds and induced greater net N mineralization. The effect of evaporation varied with the nature of the raw material. Concentration led to a slight increase in the abundance of phenolic compounds, acid-insoluble fraction, and a slight decrease in the labile fraction of vinasses partly or totally derived from sugar beet. The effect of the dilute vinasse from sugar cane was greater. The concentrated vinasse had a smaller labile fraction, induced N immobilization at the beginning of incubation, and exhibited greater N concentration in the acid-insoluble fraction than the dilute vinasse.},

Transforming a sugar mill into a bio-energy plant would contribute to climate change mitigation via the extraction of renewable electricity and ethanol. This study takes the case of the sugar industry in Thailand and identifies scenario options that offer GHG reduction benefits. Improving efficiency in electricity generation from sugar cane residues e.g. excess bagasse and cane trash is such a beneficial option. Furthermore, extracting ethanol in a so-called bio-refinery, where the co-product stillage is utilized for energy, tends to magnify the potential benefit. The largest savings potential achieved with extracting ethanol from surplus sugar versus current practice in the sugar industry in Thailand amounts to 14 million tonnes CO2e a year. This cannot be realized in practice until the carbon debt from land conversion is repaid, which takes 4.5–7 years, assuming that the land converted is grassland.},

To meet the projected fuel ethanol demand needed to oxygenate the gasoline in the whole country, the construction of about five additional ethanol production plants is required. For this, a comparative analysis of the technological options using different feedstocks should be performed. In this work, a comparison of the economical and environmental performance of the ethanol production process from sugarcane and corn under Colombian conditions has been carried out. Net present value and total output rate of potential environmental impact were used as the economical and environmental indicators, respectively. Through the integration of these indicators into one index by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach, sugarcane ethanol process was determined as the best choice for Colombian ethanol production facilities. AHP scores obtained in this study for sugarcane and corn ethanol were 0.571 and 0.429, respectively. However, starchy crops like corn, cassava or potatoes used as feedstock for ethanol production could potentially cause a higher impact on the rural communities and boost their economies if social matters are considered.},

As large scale application of vinasse has been reported to impart both benefits and demerits and data under conditions prevailing in Mauritius are lacking, the impact of disposing 25–100 m3 ha−1 vinasse in sugarcane fields on soil quality and on sugarcane production was studied in field trials at four different agroclimatic regions. Results showed that vinasse did not negatively affect soil pH and salinity. It increased slightly the soil organic carbon as well as the exchangeable K. The results, moreover, provided evidence that high application rates of vinasse would not affect cane or sugar yield. On the contrary, the data obtained during the three year study, which covered a plant cane crop and two ratoons, have shown that vinasse gave a higher cane yield (average of 84.9 T ha−1) than mineral fertilizers alone (average of 77.3 T ha−1). As all the treatment plots received the same N level, this increase in cane yield may be attributed to a better K nutrition as well as to an improvement in soil organic matter status brought about by the vinasse. The present study provides evidence that the sustainability of the productive capacity of soils in Mauritius would not be affected by the application of large doses of vinasse.},

	abstract = {The environmental impacts of bioenergy products have received a great deal of attention. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is a widely accepted method to quantify the environmental impacts of products. Conducting comprehensive LCAs for every possible bioenergy alternative is difficult because of the sheer magnitude of potential biomass sources and energy end products. The scopes of LCAs are often simplified to compare multiple products on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions and net energy balances, and may neglect equally important considerations such as nitrogen and land use. This study determines the most desirable energy crops on the basis of nitrogen and land use. The theoretical minimum nitrogen and land use requirements of fourteen bioenergy feedstocks are evaluated. These results can help prioritize certain feedstock crops for more in-depth life cycle analyses and can be used to inform policies on dedicated energy crops. The results of the study indicate that sugar cane has the best nitrogen and land use profile of the analyzed feedstocks. Sugar cane is the largest contributor to bioenergy production worldwide and is an effective policy choice from a nutrient and land use perspective. Conversely, soybeans and rapeseed are the least effective biomass sources with respect to land use and nitrogen requirements, yet these crops are also used to meet biofuel production targets worldwide. These results indicate current energy policies either do not consider or undervalue nitrogen and land use impacts, which could lead to unsustainable recommendations. Interestingly, when both nitrogen and land intensity are taken into account, reasonably small differences are seen between the remainder of the analyzed feedstocks, indicating an inherent trade-off between energy yield and nitrogen impacts.},

	abstract = {Graminaceous plant species respond to iron (Fe)-deficiency stress by enhancing the release of phytosiderophores from the roots and the uptake of Fe-phytosiderophores. For studying the mobilization and uptake of apoplasmic root Fe by barley (inherently high phytosiderophore release) and sorghum (inherently low phytosiderophore release) in axenic and nonaxenic (inoculated) nutrient solution, Fe pools in the root apoplasm were loaded during plant preculture with 10-4 M Fe(III)-EDTA. After 27 d growth in Fe-deficient nutrient solution, inoculated barley plants developed moderate Fe-deficiency chlorosis compared with the less chlorotic axenic plants. In inoculated plants, recovery of phytosiderophores and mobilization of apoplasmic root Fe tended to be slightly lower than in axenic plants, and in both treatments apoplasmic root Fe was completely depleted at harvest. As determined by the nonsoluble Fe fraction ({\textgreater} 0·2 μm) in the nutrient solution and at the rhizoplane, the microbial uptake and immobilization of apoplasmic root Fe was estimated at about 3\% of the total amount of apoplasmic root Fe after preculture and at less than 10\% of plant Fe uptake.Under axenic conditions, Fe-deficient sorghum also depleted apoplasmic root Fe and developed moderate Fe-deficiency chlorosis, although phytosiderophore recovery was 5-10-fold lower than in barley. By contrast, in inoculated sorghum plants, phytosiderophore recovery and Fe mobilization were extremely low. At harvest, in inoculated sorghum plants apoplasmic Fe pools were still considerably loaded and plant Fe uptake was c. 60\% lower than that of axenic plants, resulting in severe Fe-deficiency chlorosis. Thus, in Fe-deficient sorghum plants, the lower rate of phytosiderophore release and its degradation restricted an efficient mobilization of apoplasmic root Fe in the presence of micro-organisms. In barley, however, the higher rate of phytosiderophore release allowed a complete mobilization of apoplasmic root Fe even in inoculated nutrient solution. Furthermore, the results show that the dominating effect of micro-organisms in their competition with barley and sorghum for apoplasmic root Fe is the degradation of phytosiderophores rather than the immobilization or uptake of Fe.},

	abstract = {The economic and environmental consequences of inefficient use of nitrogen (N) fertiliser in agricultural crops is of concern worldwide, so new crop varieties with improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are sought. Here, we report the first study of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for nitrogen physiology traits in sugarcane. QTL analysis was undertaken for each parent of a segregating bi-parental sugarcane mapping population. We grew 168 progeny under limiting (0.2 mM NH4NO3) and non-limiting (5.0 mM NH4NO3) N supplies in two glasshouse experiments. Significant marker-trait associations (MTA) were detected in each treatment for shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total shoot N, shoot internal NUE (iNUE; measured as units shoot dry weight per unit N), leaf protein content and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity. MTA for GS activity did not co-locate with other traits except leaf protein content, indicating that variation in GS activity is not linked to plant size or iNUE during early growth. Under high N, there were no significant MTA for iNUE among markers from the male parent, Q165, an Australian commercial cultivar, but six MTA were found for markers inherited from the female parent, IJ76–514, a Saccharum officinarum ancestral variety. The results indicate that variation for iNUE under high N may be lower in commercial varieties than unimproved genotypes. Further, four MTA were consistent with previous field-based research on sugar and biomass production. Our study provides initial evidence that QTL may be incorporated in sugarcane breeding programs targeting improved NUE.},

Nutrient cycling in soils is considered a battle between autotrophs and heterotrophs in which the latter usually outcompete the former, although recent studies have questioned the unconditional reign of microbes on nutrient cycles and the plants' dependence on microbes for breakdown of organic matter. Here we present evidence indicative of a more active role of plants in nutrient cycling than currently considered. Using fluorescent-labeled non-pathogenic and non-symbiotic strains of a bacterium and a fungus (Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively), we demonstrate that microbes enter root cells and are subsequently digested to release nitrogen that is used in shoots. Extensive modifications of root cell walls, as substantiated by cell wall outgrowth and induction of genes encoding cell wall synthesizing, loosening and degrading enzymes, may facilitate the uptake of microbes into root cells. Our study provides further evidence that the autotrophy of plants has a heterotrophic constituent which could explain the presence of root-inhabiting microbes of unknown ecological function. Our discovery has implications for soil ecology and applications including future sustainable agriculture with efficient nutrient cycles.},

	abstract = {In the majority of agricultural growing regions, crop production is highly dependent on the supply of exogenous nitrogen (N) fertilizers. Traditionally, this dependency and the use of N-fertilizers to restore N depleted soils has been rewarded with increased plant health and yields. In recent years, increased competition for non-renewable fossil fuel reserves has directly elevated prices of N-fertilizers and the cost of agricultural production worldwide. Furthermore, N-fertilizer based pollution is becoming a serious issue for many regions where agriculture is highly concentrated. To help minimize the N footprint associated with agricultural production there is significant interest at the plant level to develop technologies which can allow economically viable production while using less applied N. To complement recent reviews examining N utilization efficiency in agricultural plants, this review will explore those strategies operating specifically at the root level, which may directly contribute to improved N use efficiencies in agricultural crops such as cereals, where the majority of N-fertilizers are used and lost to the environment. Root specific phenotypes that will be addressed in the context of improvements to N acquisition and assimilation efficiencies include: root morphology; root to shoot ratios; root vigour, root length density; and root N transport and metabolism.},

Amino acid concentrations were usually highest in the wet season and uniform across soil depth, indicating that amino acids are generated throughout the studied profile.

	abstract = {The large amounts of nitrogen (N) fertiliser applied to most cropping systems support high yields but cause N pollution. More efficient use of N in cropping systems can be achieved through improved N management practices combined with genetic improvement of the crop. The magnitude of genetic variation in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) for internal nitrogen use efficiency (iNUE, biomass produced per unit tissue N) was investigated as this could provide a basis for breeding varieties with reduced N demand. Genotypes of a mapping population were examined for biomass production and physiological variables under low or high N supply in controlled conditions. Key findings were: (i) genotypic variation for biomass production and iNUE was up to 3-fold greater under low than high N supply, (ii) elite parent Q165 was among the best performing genotypes for biomass and iNUE at high N but not at low N supply, and (iii) several genotypes had high iNUE at both N supplies. While glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) activity has been linked with grain yield in other crops, no direct relationship was observed between whole tissue GS activity and vegetative biomass or iNUE in sugarcane genotypes. Soluble protein content was negatively correlated with iNUE and biomass production. This study demonstrates that there is considerable genetic variation for iNUE in sugarcane, which can be exploited for breeding. It is proposed that breeding programs should assess genotypes not only at high N, but also at low N supply rates to select genotypes that produce high biomass with low and high N supply.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Simple indicators of crop and cultivar performance across a range of soil types and management are needed for designing and testing sustainable cropping practices. This paper determined the extent to which soil chemical and physical properties, particularly soil strength and pore-size distribution influences root elongation in a wide range of agricultural top soils, using a seedling-based indicator.
Methods Intact soil cores were sampled from the topsoil of 59 agricultural fields in Scotland, representing a wide geographic spread, range of textures and management practices. Water release characteristics, dry bulk density and needle penetrometer resistance were measured on three cores from each field. Soil samples from the same locations were sieved, analysed for chemical characteristics, and packed to dry bulk density of 1·0 g cm−3 to minimize physical constraints. Root elongation rates were determined for barley seedlings planted in both intact field and packed soil cores at a water content close to field capacity (–20 kPa matric potential).
Key Results Root elongation in field soil was typically less than half of that in packed soils. Penetrometer resistance was typically between 1 and 3 MPa for field soils, indicating the soils were relatively hard, despite their moderately wet condition (compared with {\textless}0·2 MPa for packed soil). Root elongation was strongly linked to differences in physical rather than chemical properties. In field soil root elongation was related most closely to the volume of soil pores between 60 µm and 300 µm equivalent diameter, as estimated from water-release characteristics, accounting for 65·7 \% of the variation in the elongation rates.
Conclusions Root elongation rate in the majority of field soils was slower than half of the unimpeded (packed) rate. Such major reductions in root elongation rates will decrease rooting volumes and limit crop growth in soils where nutrients and water are scarce.},

	abstract = {Background and Scope Plant responses to the toxic effects of soil contaminants, such as excess metals or organic substances, have been studied mainly at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels, but the influence on root system architecture has received little attention. Nevertheless, the precise position, morphology and extent of roots can influence contaminant uptake. Here, data are discussed that aim to increase the molecular and ecological understanding of the influence of contaminants on root system architecture. Furthermore, the potential of plant-associated bacteria to influence root growth by their growth-promoting and stress-relieving capacities is explored.
Methods Root growth parameters of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown in vertical agar plates are quantified. Mutants are used in a reverse genetics approach to identify molecular components underlying quantitative changes in root architecture after exposure to excess cadmium, copper or zinc. Plant-associated bacteria are isolated from contaminated environments, genotypically and phenotypically characterized, and used to test plant root growth improvement in the presence of contaminants.
Key Results The molecular determinants of primary root growth inhibition and effects on lateral root density by cadmium were identified. A vertical split-root system revealed local effects of cadmium and copper on root development. However, systemic effects of zinc exposure on root growth reduced both the avoidance of contaminated areas and colonization of non-contaminated areas. The potential for growth promotion and contaminant degradation of plant-associated bacteria was demonstrated by improved root growth of inoculated plants exposed to 2,4-di-nitro-toluene (DNT) or cadmium.
Conclusions Knowledge concerning the specific influence of different contaminants on root system architecture and the molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved can be combined with the exploitation of plant-associated bacteria to influence root development and increase plant stress tolerance, which should lead to more optimal root systems for application in phytoremediation or safer biomass production.},

	abstract = {Background The study of soil biota in the context of exotic plant invasions has led to an explosion in our understanding of the ecological roles of many different groups of microbes that function in roots or at the root–soil interface. Part of this progress has been the emergence of two biogeographic patterns involving invasive plants and soil microbes. First, in their non-native ranges invasive plants commonly interact differently with the same soil microbes than native plants. Second, in their native ranges, plants that are invasive elsewhere commonly interact functionally with soil microbes differently in their home ranges than they do in their non-native ranges. These studies pose a challenge to a long-held paradigm about microbial biogeography – the idea that microbes are not limited by dispersal and are thus free from the basic taxonomic, biogeographical and evolutionary framework that characterizes all other life on Earth. As an analogy, the global distribution of animals that function as carnivores does not negate the fascinating evolutionary biogeographic patterns of carnivores. Other challenges to this notion come from new measurements of genetic differences among microbes across geographic boundaries, which also suggest that meaningful biogeographic patterns exist for microorganisms.
Scope and Conclusions We expand this discussion of whether or not ‘everything is everywhere’ by using the inherently biogeographic context of plant invasions by reviewing the literature on interactions among invasive plants and the microorganisms in the rhizosphere. We find that these interactions can be delineated at multiple scales: from individual plants to continents. Thus the microbes that regulate major aspects of plant biology do not appear to be exempt from the fundamental evolutionary processes of geographical isolation and natural selection. At the important scales of taxonomy, ecotype and ecosystem functions, the fundamental ecology of invaders and soil microbes indicates that everything might not be everywhere.},

	abstract = {Background Revegetation of mine tailings (fine-grained waste material) starts with the reconstruction of root zones, consisting of a rhizosphere horizon (mostly topsoil and/or amended tailings) and the support horizon beneath (i.e. equivalent to subsoil – mostly tailings), which must be physically and hydro-geochemically stable. This review aims to discuss key processes involved in the development of functional root zones within the context of direct revegetation of tailings and introduces a conceptual process of rehabilitating structure and function in the root zones based on a state transition model.
Scope Field studies on the revegetation of tailings (from processing base metal ore and bauxite residues) are reviewed. Particular focus is given to tailings' properties that limit remediation effectiveness. Aspects of root zone reconstruction and vegetation responses are also discussed.
Conclusions When reconstructing a root zone system, it is critical to restore physical structure and hydraulic functions across the whole root zone system. Only effective and holistically restored systems can control hydro-geochemical mobility of acutely and chronically toxic factors from the underlying horizon and maintain hydro-geochemical stability in the rhizosphere. Thereafter, soil biological capacity and ecological linkages (i.e. carbon and nutrient cycling) may be rehabilitated to integrate the root zones with revegetated plant communities into sustainable plant ecosystems. A conceptual framework of system transitions between the critical states of root zone development has been proposed. This will illustrate the rehabilitation process in root zone reconstruction and development for direct revegetation with sustainable plant communities. Sustainable phytostabilization of tailings requires the systematic consideration of hydro-geochemical interactions between the rhizosphere and the underlying supporting horizon. It further requires effective remediation strategies to develop hydro-geochemically stable and biologically functional root zones, which can facilitate the recovery of the microbial community and ecological linkages with revegetated plant communities.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims During their domestication, maize, bean and squash evolved in polycultures grown by small-scale farmers in the Americas. Polycultures often overyield on low-fertility soils, which are a primary production constraint in low-input agriculture. We hypothesized that root architectural differences among these crops causes niche complementarity and thereby greater nutrient acquisition than corresponding monocultures.
Methods A functional–structural plant model, SimRoot, was used to simulate the first 40 d of growth of these crops in monoculture and polyculture and to determine the effects of root competition on nutrient uptake and biomass production of each plant on low-nitrogen, -phosphorus and -potassium soils.
Key Results Squash, the earliest domesticated crop, was most sensitive to low soil fertility, while bean, the most recently domesticated crop, was least sensitive to low soil fertility. Nitrate uptake and biomass production were up to 7 \% greater in the polycultures than in the monocultures, but only when root architecture was taken into account. Enhanced nitrogen capture in polycultures was independent of nitrogen fixation by bean. Root competition had negligible effects on phosphorus or potassium uptake or biomass production.
Conclusions We conclude that spatial niche differentiation caused by differences in root architecture allows polycultures to overyield when plants are competing for mobile soil resources. However, direct competition for immobile resources might be negligible in agricultural systems. Interspecies root spacing may also be too large to allow maize to benefit from root exudates of bean or squash. Above-ground competition for light, however, may have strong feedbacks on root foraging for immobile nutrients, which may increase cereal growth more than it will decrease the growth of the other crops. We note that the order of domestication of crops correlates with increasing nutrient efficiency, rather than production potential.},

	abstract = {The plant root defines the interface between a multicellular eukaryote and soil, one of the richest microbial ecosystems on Earth. Notably, soil bacteria are able to multiply inside roots as benign endophytes and modulate plant growth and development, with implications ranging from enhanced crop productivity to phytoremediation. Endophytic colonization represents an apparent paradox of plant innate immunity because plant cells can detect an array of microbe-associated molecular patterns (also known as MAMPs) to initiate immune responses to terminate microbial multiplication. Several studies attempted to describe the structure of bacterial root endophytes; however, different sampling protocols and low-resolution profiling methods make it difficult to infer general principles. Here we describe methodology to characterize and compare soil- and root-inhabiting bacterial communities, which reveals not only a function for metabolically active plant cells but also for inert cell-wall features in the selection of soil bacteria for host colonization. We show that the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, grown in different natural soils under controlled environmental conditions, are preferentially colonized by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and each bacterial phylum is represented by a dominating class or family. Soil type defines the composition of root-inhabiting bacterial communities and host genotype determines their ribotype profiles to a limited extent. The identification of soil-type-specific members within the root-inhabiting assemblies supports our conclusion that these represent soil-derived root endophytes. Surprisingly, plant cell-wall features of other tested plant species seem to provide a sufficient cue for the assembly of approximately 40\% of the Arabidopsis bacterial root-inhabiting microbiota, with a bias for Betaproteobacteria. Thus, this root sub-community may not be Arabidopsis-specific but saprophytic bacteria that would naturally be found on any plant root or plant debris in the tested soils. By contrast, colonization of Arabidopsis roots by members of the Actinobacteria depends on other cues from metabolically active host cells.},

	abstract = {Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plant–microbe interactions derived from complex soil communities.},

The recently discovered bacterium, Acetobacter diazotrophicus , apparently responsible for this N 2 fixation associated with the plants, has unique physiological properties for a diazotroph, such as tolerance to low pH, and high sugar and salt concentrations, lack of nitrate reductase, and nitrogenase activity which tolerates short-term exposure to ammonium. Furthermore, it also behaves as an endophyte, in that it is unable to infect sugar cane plants unless through damaged tissue or by means of VA mycorrhizae and is propagated via the planting material (stem pieces).},

	abstract = {15 N isotope and N balance studies performed over the last few years have shown that several Brazilian varieties of sugarcane are capable of obtaining over 60\% of their nitrogen ( -1 year -1 ) from biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). This may be due to the fact that this crop in Brazil has been systematically bred for high yields with low fertilizer N inputs. In the case of wetland rice, N balance experiments performed both in the field and in pots suggest that 30 to 60 N ha -1 crop -1 may be obtained from plant-associated BNF and that different varieties have different capacities to obtain N from this source. 15 N 2 incorporation studies have proved that wetland rice can obtain at least some N from BNF and acetylene reduction (AR) assays also indicate differences in N 2 -fixing ability between different rice varieties. However in situ AR field estimates suggest plant-associated BNF inputs to be less than 8 kg N ha -1 crop -1 . The problems associated with the use of the 15 N dilution technique for BNF quantification are discussed and illustrated with data from a recent study performed at EMBRAPA-CNPAB. Although many species of diazotrophs have been isolated from the rhizosphere of both sugarcane and wetland rice, the recent discovery of endophytic N 2 -fixing bacteria within roots, shoots and leaves of both crops suggests, at least in the case of sugarcane, that these bacteria may be the most important contributors to the observed BNF contributions. In sugarcane both Acetobacter diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum spp. have been found within roots and aerial tissues and these microorganisms, unlike Azospirillum spp. and other rhizospheric diazotrophs, have been shown to survive poorly in soil. Herbaspirillum spp. are found in many graminaceous crops, including rice (in roots and aerial tissue), and are able to survive and pass from crop to crop in the seeds. The physiology, ecology and infection of plants by these endophytes are fully discussed in this paper. The sugarcane/endophytic diazotroph association is the first efficient N 2 -fixing system to be discovered associated with any member of the gramineae. As yet the individual roles of the different diazotrophs in this system have not been elucidated and far more work on the physiology and anatomy of this system is required. However, the understanding gained in these studies should serve as a foundation for the improvement/development of similar N 2 -fixing systems in wetland rice and other cereal crops.},

It contained 12\% sucrose (Suc; pH 5.5.) and yielded pure cultures of an acid-producing bacterium (approximately 104 bacteria/mL extracted fluid) on N-poor medium containing 10\% Suc (pH 5.5). This bacterium was identical with the type culture of Acetobacter diazotrophicus, a recently discovered N2-fixing bacterium specific to sugarcane, with respect to nine biochemical and morphological characteristics, including acetylene reduction in air. Similar bacteria were observed in situ in the intercellular spaces. This demonstrates the presence of an N2-fixing endophyte living in apoplastic fluid of plant tissue and also that the fluid approximates the composition of the endophytes's optimal culture medium. The apoplastic fluid occupied 3\% of the stem volume; this approximates 3 tons of fluid/ha of the crop. This endogenous culture broth consisting of substrate and N2-fixing bacteria may be enough volume to account for earlier reports that some cultivars of sugarcane are independent of N fertilizers. It is suggested that genetic manipulation of apoplastic fluid composition may facilitate the establishment of similar symbioses with endophytic bacteria in other crop plants.},

	abstract = {A field trial, a lysimeter system study and a nutrient solution experiment were conducted to determine the genotypic differences in nitrogen (N) uptake among wheat (\textit{Triticum aestivum} L.) genotypes differing in vigour of early growth. Plant growth and N uptake of Vigour 18, a breeding line with early vigour, and the commercial cultivars Westonia, Tincurrin, Camm and Janz were compared. Shoot biomass of Vigour 18 was higher than that of the other genotypes, except for Westonia at booting when 50 kg N ha$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ was applied 3 d after wheat emergence. Vigour 18 had significantly higher efficiency of fertiliser-N uptake than the other four cultivars at tillering when 50 kg N ha$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ was applied. Fertiliser-N uptake efficiency at booting was similar in Vigour 18 and Westonia, but significantly higher than in three other commercial cultivars. Vigour 18 had higher root dry matter, root-length density and root surface area than Janz when examined in columns of soil. The greater root growth of Vigour 18 occurred across all soil layers to a depth of 0.6 m. Differences in total N uptake between Vigour 18 and Janz were apparent from tillering (Z14,22) to booting (Z19,24,49). Vigour 18 also had significantly higher shoot biomass and N uptake than Janz when grown in nutrient culture. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA) expressed on a whole-plant basis was higher for Vigour 18 than for Janz, and was related to total N uptake. However, NRA expressed on a per-unit-fresh-weight basis was not significantly different across the cultivars tested. It is concluded that vigorous early root and shoot growth in Vigour 18 was the main driving force for higher N uptake.},

	abstract = {Root growth is important for the acquisition of nitrogen (N) and water in deep sandy soil profiles with high leaching potential. Root growth characteristics and the N uptake of wheat genotypes differing in early vigour were investigated in 2 glasshouse experiments. In both experiments the vigorous breeding lines Vigor18 and B18 and the well-adapted commercial cultivar Janz were grown in glass-walled growth boxes in a controlled-temperature glasshouse up to the onset of stem elongation. In Expt 1, rooting parameters and detailed measurements of root growth and proliferation were made at 2-day intervals using a root mapping technique. In Expt 2 the glass-walled growth boxes were segmented into upper (0–0.2 m), middle (0.2–0.7 m), and bottom (0.7–1.0 m) soil layers, and the contribution of N fertiliser uptake by roots from each soil layer to the total plant N uptake was determined by applying 15N-urea to a single soil layer each time. The accumulated total root length across the soil profile from the 1-leaf stage to the onset of stem elongation was 33–83\% higher in the vigorous lines Vigor18 and B18 than in Janz. The roots of the 3 genotypes grew vertically down the soil profile at a similar rate, but the roots of vigorous lines branched earlier and grew horizontally faster and more extensively than those of cv. Janz, resulting in a greater root-length density and root number in the top 0.7-m soil layer. Uptake of N fertiliser by roots in the upper 0–0.2 m of the soil profile was 60–68\% higher in the vigorous lines than in Janz. Roots of the vigorous lines located in the segment 0.2–0.7 m of the soil profile captured twice as much N fertiliser than those of Janz. Uptake of N fertiliser by roots in the lower 0.7–1.0 m of the soil profile was similar in the vigorous lines and Janz. This indicates that the early and more extensive horizontal growth of the roots in the 0.2–0.7 m of the soil profile was responsible for the superior uptake of N by the vigorous lines. The implications of these genotypic differences in root growth and proliferation and their relationship with the early acquisition of N are discussed with emphasis on their role in improving the efficiency of N fertiliser uptake and reducing nitrate leaching, particularly in the sandy soils of the Mediterranean climatic region of Australia.},

	abstract = {Modern agriculture is based on the notion that nitrate is the main source of nitrogen (N) for crops, but nitrate is also the most mobile form of N and easily lost from soil. Efficient acquisition of nitrate by crops is therefore a prerequisite for avoiding off-site N pollution. Sugarcane is considered the most suitable tropical crop for biofuel production, but surprisingly high N fertilizer applications in main producer countries raise doubt about the sustainability of production and are at odds with a carbon-based crop. Examining reasons for the inefficient use of N fertilizer, we hypothesized that sugarcane resembles other giant tropical grasses which inhibit the production of nitrate in soil and differ from related grain crops with a confirmed ability to use nitrate. The results of our study support the hypothesis that N-replete sugarcane and ancestral species in the Andropogoneae supertribe strongly prefer ammonium over nitrate. Sugarcane differs from grain crops, sorghum and maize, which acquired both N sources equally well, while giant grass, Erianthus, displayed an intermediate ability to use nitrate. We conclude that discrimination against nitrate and a low capacity to store nitrate in shoots prevents commercial sugarcane varieties from taking advantage of the high nitrate concentrations in fertilized soils in the first three months of the growing season, leaving nitrate vulnerable to loss. Our study addresses a major caveat of sugarcane production and affords a strong basis for improvement through breeding cultivars with enhanced capacity to use nitrate as well as through agronomic measures that reduce nitrification in soil.},
