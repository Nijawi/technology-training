Cleaning data with OpenRefine

---

Clean, explore and augment messy tabular data with OpenRefine

---

OpenRefine is self-described as "a power tool for dealing with messy data". It can help you deal with inconsistencies in data stored in a tabular format (spreadsheets, CSV files, etc.).

It can help you:

* Get an overview of a data set
* Resolve inconsistencies in a data set, for example standardizing date formatting
* Help you split data up into more granular parts, for example splitting up cells with multiple authors into separate cells
* Match local data up to other data sets, for example in matching local subjects against the Library of Congress Subject Headings
* Enhance a data set with data from other sources

In this hands-on CDS session, you will learn:

1. how to import and export data;
2. what "facets" and "filters" are;
3. how to edit cells and correct inconsistencies;
4. how to reorganise data;
5. how to group and transform data with GREL commands.

Please install OpenRefine on your laptop before coming to this session: 
If you haven't been able to do so, please come 15 minutes earlier to install it.
Library computers also have the software available on them.
