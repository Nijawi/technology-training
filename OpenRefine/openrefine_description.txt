Cleaning up data with OpenRefine

Clean up, explore and augment messy tabular data with OpenRefine

---

OpenRefine is self-described as "a power tool for dealing with messy data". It can help you deal with inconsistencies in data stored in a tabular format (spreadsheets, CSV files, etc.).

It can help you:

* Get an overview of a data set
* Resolve inconsistencies in a data set, for example standardizing date formatting
* Help you split data up into more granular parts, for example splitting up cells with multiple authors into separate cells
* Match local data up to other data sets, for example in matching local subjects against the Library of Congress Subject Headings
* Enhance a data set with data from other sources

In this hands-on CDS session, you will learn:

1. how to import and export data;
2. what "facets" and "filters" are;
3. how to edit cells and correct inconsistencies;
4. how to reorganise data;
5. how to group and transform data with GREL commands.


We recommend using the library computers available in the training room, which have the software available on them.
However, if you wish to use your own device, please install OpenRefine 2.8 on it before coming to this session: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions. If you haven't been able to do so, please come 15 minutes earlier to install it.
