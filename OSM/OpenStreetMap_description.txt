OpenStreetMap: contribute and use the data

---

Learn how to contribute geographical data to OpenStreetMap, and use the database in QGIS.

---

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open-licence spatial database.

In this hands-on session, you will learn how to:

    Digitise geographical data into the OSM database
    Use an editor directly from the browser
    Contribute local data as well as data useful to humanitarian action across the world
    Make use of OSM data in QGIS to create a custom map

You do not need any prior knowledge to attend this session.

Before the session, please have a look at the OpenStreetMap website and make note of something that is missing near your home.

The software is available on the Library's training computers, but if you want to work on your own laptop, please install QGIS before coming to the session (version 3.4).
