# QGIS: Introduction to mapping

## Setting up

This tutorial is designed for **QGIS 3.10**. If you need to install it on your computer, got to the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).

Open QGIS and create a **new project** with `Project > New`.
Let's straight away **save** our project: `Project > Save`. We should create a new folder, where our project and all the saved data will live, named "qgis_raster_intro" for example.

Let's set the **project home** too: `Project > Properties > General` and set `Project home` to the same folder. This is where we can also give the project a title.

Let's also add an OpenStreetMap basemap to locate ourselves on the globe: `Browser panel > XYZ Tiles > OpenStreetMap` (double-click, or drag and drop into the Layers panel).
